   "reviews": "['The ROG M16 is one of the most premium choices available in terms of aesthetics and usability for under $2,000. I tried out the G14 (3060 variant), G15 (3070 variant), and this laptop (3060 variant) for a considerable amount of time before ultimately deciding on keeping this laptop. I am confident others in this market are debating among these three models, so I will try justifying my reasonings with what I really liked about the M16 over the other.\\n\\nThings I liked:\\n1. Finish: the M16 has a velvety/leathery finish on the chassis, keyboard, and trackpad that isn’t found on the other two laptops. Whereas the G14 and G15 is only a magnesium chassis that is colder to touch, the M16 feels more like soft carbon fiber which makes it more premium and improves the typing experience. \\n\\n2. Screen: Easily the biggest factor for many people considering this laptop, the M16 has a bigger screen, yet the size of the laptop is identical to the G15. This means that the M16 is nearly bezeless. After using this laptop for a day, I wasn’t able to ignore the fat chin that is present on the G15. To make things even more attractive, the M16 screen registers about 550 nits in brightness (G14 and G15 only have 350 nits). What’s the real-world difference between these different brightnesses? I like studying in cafes by the windows. With the G14 and G15 on max brightness, I still had a less-than-pleasant time reading the screen. The M16 at 70% brightness reaches the max brightness of the G15. With the M16 at max brightness, I can see everything clearly even in the face of sunlight. Lastly, the M16 has much more accurate colors than the G14/G15. The G15 seems to have a slight green tint to every color, and I didn’t notice this until I started using the M16.\\n\\n3. Webcam: the M16 separates itself from the G14 and G15 with a 720p webcam. I thought that I could live without a webcam, but I quickly realized how much I missed it when I couldn’t video chat with friends or use it for work needs. Buying an external webcam would not only cost more money but would also be cumbersome to plug in or put away. The webcam on the M16 is nothing special (bonus points had it been 1080p) but having a bad but convenient integrated webcam is magnitudes better than having a good but inconvenient external webcam.\\n\\n4. Temperature: the M16 with the i9-11900h has lower temperatures (to my surprise) than the G14 and G15 with the Ryzen 9 5800. At idle and under CPU stress, the M16 managed to be about 5 degrees Celsius cooler. While this didn’t translate into a longer battery for the M16 (Intel chips still draw much more power than Ryzen), it did make for more comfortable gaming sessions. One of the reasons the temperature is lower is because the fans on the M16 seem to spin much louder than the G14 and G15.\\n\\n5. Quality control: while my M16 didn’t have any significant issues that I experienced with the G15 (backlight bleeding, warped screen, chassis creaking), my M16 still has some slight chassis creaking that I don’t mind enough to return. Reading other people’s reviews, it seems that the M16 has better quality control than the G15. However, the G14 still has the best quality control of all three.\\n\\n6. Speakers: the speakers of the M16 and G15 are identical in sound quality. They are superb for gaming laptops but not nearly as good as the ones found in the M1 Macbook. The G14 speakers sounded distorted and buzzed when at max volume which was very annoying.\\n\\nThings I didn’t like:\\n1. Battery life: I am noticing nearly 20% less battery in the M16 compared to the G15. This is attributed mainly to the intel chip drawing about 10 watts more than the Ryzen chip. While this was a tough pill to swallow as I am a student, I can compromise because the battery life still averages around 6 hours on full charge, and the M16 conveniently supports USB C charging. The battery life is not enough for me to give up its god-like screen and webcam.\\n\\n2. Value: do not be mistaken, you are paying a massive premium for the portability, screen, and battery of the M16. My laptop with a 3060 costs as much as the 3070 G15. 3060 laptops with the same or higher TDP (wattage) in 2021 can be found for $1200. The M16 is suited for the person who is willing to pay for portability and battery. I would not recommend this machine to anybody who is looking for just a gaming computer. It can currently play any AAA title on 1080p high to max settings with about 60-100 fps, but you won’t be able to play on its native 1440p resolution. I would recommend waiting for the 3070 variant that comes out later if you want to tackle 1440p gaming.', 'Gaming enthusiasts have been anxiously anticipating the appearance of the new Asus M16 gaming laptops and speculating about their potential configurations. The wait is over and Asus has delivered their newest ROG (Republic of Gamers) laptop models, and I was extremely pleased to acquire one at the earliest possible opportunity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new Asus ROG Zephyrus M16 GU603HM-211.ZM16 is an absolutely outstanding machine. Its excellent specifications are matched with incredible performance. It is extremely fast and powerful and the graphics are stunning.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have purchased several Asus laptops over more than the past decade. I have been a fan of Asus laptops because they are typically very good, reliable machines.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe M16 GU603HM-211.ZM16 is preloaded with Windows 10 Home Edition. After completing the Windows 10 setup process the user is prompted to sign into (or create) their MyAsus account which allows for automated product registration, as well as a system check for updates. The MyAsus app immediately offered a Bios update. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe M16 is thin, compact and relatively lightweight. The black M16 case (a white case is also offered) is plastic with perforations on the top and a reflective, prismatic film that is aesthetically interesting. The top incorporates a unique “Ergolift” hinge design which has a cam shape that elevates the bottom of the laptop as the top is rotated open, ostensibly to provide additional space for air circulation under the laptop. The Ergolift hinge only provides additional elevation when the display panel is rotated beyond approximately 90°. The hinge is not full-width, and there is a fair amount of flex in the thin top case which necessitates using due care when opening and closing the lid, which appears to be somewhat delicate. The hinge allows 180° rotation of the case allowing the opened laptop to lay flat on a table. The bottom of the case also incorporates a full-width fixed rubber foot for airflow. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are cooling vents located on either side, the rear and bottom of the case. The M16 is equipped with two fans and six heat pipes to moderate operating temperatures. Thermals can be monitored via Armoury Crate, and system performance is likewise managed through that app to manage system thermals and battery consumption rate. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe cooling vents located on the rear of the case direct heated airflow directly at the lower quadrant of the display panel. The potential effects of the heat exposure on the display panel is undetermined. I hope that Asus has thoroughly evaluated this issue.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe case and palm-rest area below the keyboard and surrounding the very large, very responsive touch pad, is a soft-touch, rubbery material which has a tendency to show fingerprints and handprints. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe keyboard has excellent feel and response. The key travel is ideal with just the right amount of resistance and rapid return. The keys are fairly quiet, as well. However, in an evident design concession to providing speaker grilles on both sides of the keyboard, there is no numeric (NumPad) adjacent to the keyboard. I miss the ancillary numeric keypad in general, but it is specifically useful with certain games, including Flight Simulator. There is an array of media keys above the keyboard, but there is no PrintScreen key. The keyboard has single zone RGB backlighting. The backlighting is good and entertaining, with a variety of colors, patterns and options available through Asus Armoury Crate. The M16 has a large, approximately 5-1/4” x 3-11/32” glass touchpad, which offers exceptionally smooth functionality.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Asus Armoury Crate app is a robust dashboard which provides a comprehensive array of real-time system performance data including CPU, Memory, Thermals, Fan speed, etc., and allows setting parameters for the screen, keyboard lighting, customized scenarios, and other system settings. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe M16 provides a fingerprint sensor for biometric security, which is very cleverly integrated into the laptop’s power switch. Depressing the power button stores a fingerprint which is forwarded for authentication during the boot process. This very unique and cool feature is working very reliably. Only one fingerprint is stored, however. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe M16 series are all Intel based machines, with a couple of i7 models and a variety of I9 based variants. The M16 GU603HM-211.ZM16, is a well-equipped, nicely configured mid-tier model. The CPU is an Intel, Tiger-Lake, 11th generation Core i9-11900H (8Core/16Thread), 2.5 GHz (with a maximum clock speed up to 4.9 GHz!!!) chip with 24MB Cache, installed with liquid metal for optimal heat conductance and dissipation from this powerful CPU. Intel lists the TDP (Thermal Design Power) at 45 Watts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe M16 series has NVIDIA GeForce RTX30 Series GPUs, ranging from the RTX3050 to the RTX3070. The M16 GU603HM-211.ZM16 is equipped with the RTX3060 which is based on the GA106 Ampere chip and comes with 6GB of GDDR6 graphics memory and 80 Watts TDP (95Watts with Dynamic Boost). The RTX3060 also boasts 2nd Generation Ray Tracing Cores and 3rd Generation Tensor Cores, which greatly speed up graphics computations and rendering. Some other M16 models are equipped with the RTX3070 GPU with 8 GB of memory.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the i9 powerhouse CPU and the superb RTX3060 GPU, the highlight of the M16 is the display.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe M16 has a 16” panel mounted in a 15.6” frame. The M16 panel is a 16:10, AU Optronics WQHD 2560x1600 IPS, 165 Hz refresh rate, 3ms response time panel, 100% DCI-P3 with Adaptive Sync, Pantone Validated panel with Dolby Vision. This panel is ideally suited to gaming with its tall aspect ratio, fast refresh rate and response time, and absolutely outstanding color fidelity, and the Adaptive Sync which prevents stuttering and frame tearing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe display panel is phenomenal. It is a bright, clear, fast, almost flawless display that is a pleasure to look at. \\r\\n\\r\\nGame visuals and game performance are genuinely outstanding! The color rendition is incredible, and performance is likewise superb thanks to the combination of a powerful CPU, great GPU and fabulous display panel. Even the most resource intensive games ran flawlessly. From GTA V, to Call of Duty to Assassin’s Creed to Flight Simulator 2020, every game was smooth, fast and flawless. There was no lag, stutter, frame tearing or other performance deficits. Gameplay was incredibly smooth and responsive. The M16 provided the best gaming experience that I have encountered!\\r\\n\\r\\nResultant from the 16” panel residing in a 15.6” frame, the bezels are incredibly thin. The bezels measure approximately 6/32” wide on the sides and approximately 12/32” wide on the top. The top bezel has the addition of a 720p, HD webcam at its center. Asus located three large LED indicators for Power, Charging and Disk Activity on the top, rear edge of the case, immediately below the display panel. This results in those LEDs being reflected on the screen, which is most noticeable when dark scenes are displayed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe M16 GU603HM-211.ZM16 has 8 GB of DDR4 memory soldered to the board, and another 8GB on a 3200 MHz DIMM. The system supports a maximum 40 GB of memory. Other M16 variants have different amounts of memory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe M16 GU603HM-211.ZM16 supports PCIe 4.0, however this model is equipped with a 1TB M.2 NVMe PCIe 3.0 SSD. Some other M16 models are equipped with PCIe 4.0 SSDs ranging from 520GB to 2TB capacity. I do not understand the provision of the PCIe 3.0 SSD, when PCIe 4.0 provides double the bandwidth (64GB), double the Gigatransfer bit rate (32GT/s) and double the frequency (16GHz) and ensures the absolute fastest load times and performance of drive-speed dependent software.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe types and quantities of ports for connectivity are fairly good, especially considering the thin form-factor of the M16. On the right side of the case there is one USB-A 3.2 Gen1 port and one MicroSD Card reader. On the left side of the case there is a barrel plug type DC power port for use with the 240 Watt, 20 Volt DC @ 12 Amp power supply, one HDMI 2.0b port, one RJ45 LAN port, one Thunderbolt 4 port, one USB-C 3.2 Gen2 Display/Power Delivery port, and one 3.5mm Audio jack. The left side of the case is congested, and the ports are near the front where USB cables and drives are most likely to be in the way. Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) is supported as well as dual band Bluetooth 5.2. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe M16 audio is outstanding. There are six speakers comprised of 2 tweeters and 4 woofers delivering Dolby Atmos audio with remarkable spatial qualities that really enhances the gaming experience. However, the audio volume levels are somewhat conservative.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe M16 is powered by a 90 Wh, four cell Li-ion battery, with fast charging that recovers 50% of charge in 30 minutes. Although it is best to be plugged in when gaming, during other utilization, the excellent battery capacity and performance, and extremely rapid recharge is appreciated. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is interesting that Asus elected to make the M16 an Intel based system. Perhaps this was a strategic decision to make the M16 a more diversified, rather than single purpose system? In fact, the M16 is not only suitable for gaming (although it is certainly tailored to be a gaming “beast”). Resource demanding, graphics intensive creative applications including Adobe Creative Cloud applications and AutoCAD perform brilliantly on the M16. The M16 is extremely well suited to creative work and business productivity use as well as gaming.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn summary, the Asus ROG Zephyrus M16 GU603HM-211.ZM16 is the best, most robust laptop that I have experienced. It is outstanding in every respect and its suitability to all CPU and GPU demanding games and applications is extraordinarily impressive. I can unhesitatingly recommend the Asus ROG Zephyrus M16 GU603HM-211.ZM16!', \"You get a lot of machine for you money with this laptop. The i9 absolutely is a beast, and paired with the RTX 3060, this machine will handle most anything you throw at it. It's fast refresh rate is also very welcome, especially if you're targetting the highest framerate possible, and willing to turn off a few bells and whistles to get there. If you're after resolution and image quality, this laptop will definitely hit the mark too.I ran a few modern games without any performance issues whatsoever. Gears 5 and Forza Horizon 4 performed perfectly at Ultra settings and look amazing. With Gears, that was even with Global Illumination. Very impressive for a laptop. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you're not gaming, Asus also has some cool profile modes that are built in to help keep the battery life as long as possible and the fans low or off, making it quiet in these modes. However, be prepared for this machine to put off some heat and moderate fan noise when under heavy loads. Using it in my lap while playing, it gets pretty warm, though that's to be excpected with the i9 and 3060 working hard. Those same components will also drain the battery, which again, is to be expected when they're under load. Asus also added a nice little touch of being able to set the RGB lighting of the keyboard to match what's on screen. It's a neat little touch that makes it even more of a pleasure to use. There's also a fingerprint reader nicely hidden on the power button. It's been very fast in my experience too. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe monitor is very nice quality, with a nice finish and excellent color reproduction. It also has very little bezel, so you get a lot of screen for a machine this size. Of course, not to mention that i's capable of 165Hz! It's also very easy to get a good angle on, as it can be pushed as far back as to be flat with the keyboard. There is one minor annoyance I have though, and that's with the indicator lights on the base that can sometimes be seen on the screen. It's not a huge issue though.\\r\\n\\r\\nAudio is also handled very well for a portable machine. It supports Dolby Atmos, and sounds pretty great overall. The built-in mic array seemed to work well for the few times I used it as well. I didn't have any complaints about voice quality.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharging is a nice surprise too. Asus claims it can charge 50% in about 30 minutes, and that was definitely the case in my exerpience. Which is excellent if you're going to do any gaming on battery power.\\r\\n\\r\\nI added a couple of screenshots from some benchmarks I did in Gears 5 and Forza Horizon 4 as well. You can see how easily this laptop handles those games, even with a high performance target. Very easy to recommend this laptop if you're in the market for a well-performing portable gaming machine.\\r\\n\\r\\nPros: Excellent performance, helpful modes from Asus when in and out of gaming, nice looking laptop with some neat features for RGB lighting and Audio.\\r\\n\\r\\nCons: Can get fairly loud and warm under load, indicator lights can be a bit distracting in their location as they can be seen on the monitor.\", 'The Asus ROG Zephyrus M16:\\r\\n\\r\\nBeauty, elegance, and grace everything molded into one epic gaming laptop. One that’s going to be very hard for companies to beat. The ROG M16. This is literally the best PC/Laptop I have ever owned full stop. Here is some history; My main current gaming rig was an Intel i5 4770…Yes. Haswell, DDR3 32GB, MSI-G45 Gaming motherboard, and RTX 2070 Super. I been holding on to my PC since 2013 as I upgraded as far as I could go. I also used 3x 16:9 screens @ refresh rate up to 240hz (PC was good @1440p.) But I can tell you now nothing compares to the experience I had with this MONSTER of a laptop. A buttery smooth experience I cannot express in words when playing GTA V, Gears 5, Resident Evil: Village, Doom Eternal, Battlefield V, Ace Combat and so much more @ blazing framerate! \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Presentation:\\r\\n\\r\\nA fantastic presentation has been put into this thing. Asus ROG Zephyrus M16 unboxing experience was great. The laptop pops out and presents itself to you. Not much in the box but a 240w power brick plug. There is also some paperwork.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Design: \\r\\n\\r\\nThe laptop itself feels amazing the material Asus use here feels very smooth to the touch. The material is a fingerprint magnet so I won’t sugar coat that. ASUS claims it minimizes fingerprints but I highly doubt that. The Soft-touch paint material feels awesome on the palms when typing though. It’s mostly designed like any other laptop and doesn’t necessarily stand out as a gaming laptop. Creators looking for something powerful and less flashy would probably be drawn to this one. The dot Matrix lid of the laptop has a nice prism shine with the black just is killing it with design. Some may hate it but I love the look personally. Gotta keep the gamer elements as a tradition and laptops.\\r\\n\\r\\n16:10 display takes over almost entirely the whole screen. It’s impressive what they manage to put squeeze here. The power LEDs lights bounce off the display at the bottom but it’s not too distracting. I do think however it will bother some people who play at night, definitely need a way to turn them off in future update. Also, I appreciate the RGBs on here but they are single zone which to me is a disappointment. Still, with this laptop being so powerful I can’t fault any stars for RGB. The RGB on the Keyboard does get bright with 3 levels of brightness. The trackpad is more precise than my MSI, nice and full instead of being oddly wide. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe keyboard is nice, every click has a refinement to it. It’s a perfect placement in the middle of the laptop. RGB doesn’t bleed too much but it is nice to use. The fingerprint scanner is fast; it also holds your print until your turn on the laptop to log you into Windows. Not too many media keys just Volume up / down key, Mute, and an “Armoury Crate” button. \\r\\n\\r\\nA button that’s designed to take you to an App that lets you fine-tune your M16. Here you can do performance profiles, Change RGB, check the status of your workstation, change visuals, and there is even a store to buy games. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe bottom of the laptop can be unscrewed and can be upgraded with another NVME drive and you can add a single stick of RAM if so desired (Comes with 8GB DDR4 RAM + 8GB on Board.) I put a 2TB Samsung 980 Pro inside. I appreciate this because after owning an MSI Stealth with a flip motherboard, it sucks not upgrading your own quickly. Also at the bottom of the M16 is raised a little higher so it has made the intake airflow is easier. Speaking of Airflow, most seem concerned about direct from the back airflow hitting the pixels of the screen. As the 16:10 screen reaches down and I too agree with this. Only time will tell what will happen. \\r\\n\\r\\nROG M16 also has tons of I/O ports for whatever you probably need it for in a modern gaming PC. There is a 3.5mm Combo Audio Jack, HDMI 2.0, USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A, USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C (Support DisplayPort and power delivery), LAN port, and microSD. Can charge the laptop with USB-C @ 100w as well. Bluetooth works fantastic and keeps in sync with an Xbox One controller. WiFi 6 is strong and stays connected to an ASUS RT-AX88U that I own giving blazing performance and compatibility between the two. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Screen:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe screen is bright, bold, and vivid with beautiful colors. Where do I even start? The striking vividness of the 16-inch WQHD 16:10 display? The small thin bezels around the border of the screen? Dolby Vision? Pantone validation? 2560x1600 @ 165hz is maybe a good place to start since your eyes are going to be drawn to the screen most of the time. It’s every bit of awesome this as it sounds, all these things are pack into this laptop to give you a real gaming experience. Using Dolby Vision on this screen was the pinnacle of my awe. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gaming: \\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s perfect. It does it well. It’s super fast. Why? Nvidia’s RTX 3060 can hold its own with this screen. Gaming has been absolutely the best. Jaw-dropping framerates, Visual fidelity, Resizable Bar, Dolby Vision / Atoms on Gears 5, Fast loading in photo mode in games…it does it all. It makes me smile gaming at a resolution. Intel i9 11900h H45 10nm truly holds its own in gaming, a powerful processor (8c/16t) unlike anything I owned before. Things are just faster. Every component seems to be in sync with each other when using it. 1TB NvME drive gives plenty of space for some games starting. \\r\\n\\r\\nGTA V with maxed settings was getting on about 83+FPS at native resolution, Gears 5 / maxed settings about 65+FPS, Doom Eternal / Ultra Nightmare Settings about 90+ FPS, Forza Horizon 5 Maxed Settings = 90+ FPS, Fortnite 1440p/Ultra = 87+FPS, & Village Resident Evil = 60+ FPS. Keep in mind this is all mostly max settings using @ 2560x1600. On a thin and light laptop, It blows me away every time. Setting it to 1080p here would get you lots of gains in performance. It’s great at what it can do as is paired with the adaptive display screen. RayTracyed games always is a visual treat to see and DLSS gives the laptop a huge boost. Fans kick in when using but it’s not overly distracting like Acer Nitro 5 series. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sound:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe speakers are incredible. Super rich audio sound and clarity. 6 speakers in this laptop are very loud at the maximum volume. Certainly better than any speakers on any laptop I’ve had once before. Dolby Atmos is supported inside this laptop. Sounds just really good, tried out some demos with Dolby Access app, I highly recommend it. Showcases some stunning sound and footage on your laptop and HDR. The sound is awesome and has some level of bass near the bottom of the M16. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Webcam and microphone:\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, a good webcam and mic on a laptop were long desired. It’s also very small within the bezel border along the top. The microphone is very good because it has multiple ways of inputting sound with AI noise canceling. Cardioid mode captures sound from right in front of the laptop, Stereo mode uses right and left channels to record so two people can use it at once, and Omnidirectional mode picks up sound from every area around for something like conference calls/office calls. All of this can be accessed in Armoury Crate software. The point is I can see this being ok for streaming and communication use. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Battery life: It’s ok, about on par with other gaming laptops. Intel i9 is very power efficient when doing basic tasks. It actually for me lasted about 6hr and 45mins from full battery to zero, with brightness near 75%. Fast charging can bring the battery up 50% in about 33 mins so it’s very rapid when charging. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe weight: ROG M16 is good much lighter than something I’ve used before. Good to carry around a screen this huge in a 15-inch body. Very sleek and portable which I very much will take with me on the go. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end, everything I just wrote about won’t do the Asus ROG Zephyrus M16 justice. Something you have to see and use to understand. All of the elements that make this laptop combine into a gaming experience unlike any other…that’s definitely something ASUS delivered on. If reviews didn’t have word limits I would keep going on and on about its features. I can’t stop gaming on it, can’t stop using it, even think about how good it is. I believe this laptop is going to be extremely popular with gamers in this current climate. From one long-time gamer to another…this one is a beast. Beyond 5 stars for the Zephyrus M16 and worth every single penny.', 'It was a tough decision between all gaming laptops available in the market. I was looking for a laptop that could last at least +7 years, as my old 2012 did.\\n\\nThe 16inch @165Hz is excellent not just for gaming but also for productivity. With its thin bezel, this laptop will age well. The design is solid, which makes a 2020 Legion 5 look outdated.\\nThe i9-11900H has a superb performance as well as the RTX3060. At peak utilization, gets HOT but the fan does a great job of maintaining the temp, so it does not go to thermal throttle. Fans at 100% speed are noisy. You can undervolt the CPU down to -80mV and tweak the power usage using the ROG Armoury Crate as well as the GPU. The top center, where the status LEDs are, also gets hot but isn’t a big issue since you don’t really reach your hands up there.\\n\\nThe mouse touchpad is nice and large. The keyboard is good, but the only downside are the tiny arrow keys. Keyboard backlight LEDs can be seen at certain angle, which sometimes distracts me a little bit.\\n\\nThe weight and size are great compare to some other gaming laptops.\\n\\nA downside I see is the onboard memory that comes with this particular model GU603HM-211.ZM16, is just 8GB.', \"It's hard to know what you're missing out on when compared to other laptops if you've never owned a gaming laptop of a similar caliber to the M16. If you get the M16 I guarantee there will be a lot you will be satisfied with a lot like me and others who have left their reviews here. It's still important, however, to contemplate what features you truly desire and then decide what laptop you're going to buy. \\n\\nYou could be buying a Lenovo Legion 5 Pro instead of this, which has the same bright 16 inch screen, twice the storage and a higher wattage RTX 3070 for the same the price as this laptop. You could also get a Zephyrus G15 for the same price as this which has AMD and an RTX 3070 for the same price point. You could get an Eluktronics Mech laptop, which offers the best performance for the money. \\n\\nYou should only be getting this laptop if you absolutely want it for it's specialties. In this case it would be the brighter taller display, combined with a slightly weaker performance and slightly better design than the Zephyrus G15. If you're looking for a pure monster gaming machine that is relatively portable, then there are better options for your money. \\n\\nI can also state some additional pros of this laptop. One of them being the excellent keyboard typing experience (though there is no prt scn key if you need that). The speakers being relatively good especially when compared to almost every other gaming laptop out there. The Armoury Crate software does offer some useful performance, cooling control, and battery saving options. Optimal laziness with the finger-print reader. The overall design being sleek, light, and not to gamery despite the ROG branding.\\n\\nThe only downsides to this laptop I think really come down to value: what you're buying it for and when you compare it to other laptops. You could argue fan noise is problematic, but most gaming laptop fans blow and sound like a hurricane (which is good because the last thing you want is some weak fans on you thin and light gaming laptop).\", 'Gamers are notoriously picky, and I feel it’s hard for gamers to find that ‘perfect’ laptop. Boy, does this one come close. I can’t imagine another laptop giving you the same value and performance.\\r\\n\\r\\n For perspective, we purchased a gaming laptop at the beginning of last summer. We were stuck home and needed a new computer, so we decided on a nice gaming laptop. We went with an ASUS ROG G15, it was rocking a AMD Ryzen 7 chipset with a NVIDIA GTX 1660 chipset. Needless to say, this has taken our experience to a new level.\\r\\n\\r\\n Build quality is what you would come to expect from ASUS. It feels premium, and unlike some other gaming laptops, the design here is subtle. I would have no problem taking this out at work and using in a meeting. The lid has a unique subtle chromatic effect. You do get the RGB lighting around the keyboard, but this can also be tweaked to fit your taste or situation. The area around the keyboard/trackpad is covered in a soft rubbery material. It can show some oils, but a quick wipe down clears it up. We had an older gaming laptop that had a similar finish that held up pretty well, but we wiped it down periodically. I love that the screen can fold all the way back so you can always find that sweet spot when viewing the screen. The screen itself feels thin and the bezels are super thin. It’s astonishing they could fit a 16” screen in such a small footprint. Going back to the keyboard/trackpad for a minute; I can honestly say that it is one of my favorite keyboards to use. I prefer it over my other wired and bluetooth keyboards. The only other keyboard I have enjoyed using this much was the one on my M1 MacBook Pro. The trackpad is also huge and super nice to use, but for gaming, I obviously prefer to go with a separate mouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerformance is amazing. This thing rocks some very respectful specs. It has the new 11th gen i9-11900H processor with 16gb of RAM, 1TB of fast SSD, and a NVIDIA RTX 3060 graphics cards with 6gb of RAM. Needless to say, this laptop can handle any game you toss at it. As you can imagine, I am running games at max/ultra graphic settings and getting high frame rates. Even in long gaming sessions, I never noticed performance being throttled back because of thermal issues. The fans can get loud, but that is kind of expected in just about any gaming laptop. Fan noise is kind of the sacrifice we have come to expect from having portable gaming powerhouses. I played some Fortnite, Valorant, Borderlands 3, Witcher 3, Control, Minecraft, WoW, CoD, and Apex. I was able to run all of these games at the highest graphical setting with some of the NVIDIA RTX features on, and was hitting frame rates generally over 100 for most of the games with a couple coming into the 80s. Again, with highest settings, the RTX setting enabled, and zero throttling. I have no worries about running any game on this beast. Saying its future proof is difficult to say with any piece of gaming equipment since things change so quickly, but this is as close to that as I think you’re gonna get in a portable system.\\r\\n\\r\\nBattery life is respectful. I was able to use it at work and managed to get through most of my day without having to charge it. This was with email, using the browser, Teams conferences, Excel, and streaming some video. I’d say about 5-6 hours and I was still left with a little battery at the end of the day. NVIDIA and Asus do a great job of managing power when on battery. I didn’t game like this, but for work it’s definitely manageable.\\r\\n\\r\\nI can’t imagine finding another laptop that offers so much in such a great portable package. You get the new Tiger Lake Intel i9 processor, 16gb of RAM, 1TB of fast SSD storage, the amazing NVIDIA RTX 3060 graphics card, and you get to view that all that power through a beautiful 16” 2560 x 1440 WQXGA screen able to run at 165Hz. All this power and it still manages to keep the weight under 5 lbs. It’s just amazing. This is an easy recommendation for anyone looking at pushing their gaming experience higher. Definitely my favorite piece of tech this year.', \"All around a great laptop. The panel is beautiful with only a slight light bleed, color, brightness is OLED like but it is fast and smooth. Keyboard is one zone RGB and has all the I/O you'll need. Mine had a good build quality with very slight creaking on bezel by the webcam area. Oh ya it has a WEBCAM! I personally don't care either way but it is nice just to have it.  Wish they had the option to get the RTX3070 but they don't. RTX3060 is good and will handle most AAA titles. Also wish they can get this panel with the Ryzen chip instead of Intel, but I guess that is why they have the G15. Which let me add its a good laptop too, but the screen is not that bright and there is a lot different QC issues, I bought 4 and returned 4, all had some sort of speaker popping noise, creaking in the chassis and few other issues. I am picky but I am not dropping 1900 for a laptop with bad QC out of the box. Over all this is a great laptop that can handle anything you throw at it for work and play. Very little compromise on this gaming laptop for a reasonable price. Oh ya the LED indicator in the middle of the laptop doesn't reflect off the panel that will bother you, only if you turn the brightness complete down in a completely dimmed room. Other wise its not that noticeable\", 'I needed a new computer to do video editing on — the young man that helped me, showed me a few options on the floor. Then we looked in the open box section and found my new computer. \\nIt’s fast and responsive and I’m looking forward to editing many videos.', 'I purchased an Open-Box Excellent because these were sold out at the time I purchased one. Unfortunately, I can see why the original customer returned it. The backlight bleeding on the bottom left corner of the laptop I received is extremely noticeable, which is a bummer because the laptop itself is beautiful. I will be returning this one mainly because the backlight bleed is noticeable even without a black or dark background. I will be purchasing a new one, hoping that there will be better quality control for the laptop display.', \"I was very excited to get this product but got disappointed very quickly. In the very first hour of using it, a blue line appeared on the screen which is obviously a screen defect. Are you serious???? How's it gonna last under gaming performance with this poor quality?!!!! I'm going to return it and get another brand!\", \"The Asus Zephyrus M16 (GU603) is the next in a relatively recent line of amazing laptops from Asus. Asus, once plagued with boring generic designs, has really hit its stride in the ROG Zephyrus series. While the previous G series had its highlights (most notably the popular G14) the M16 brings a lot of the same design cues, but even more refinement.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo what does the GU603 bring to the table? How about desktop class computing from a 10nm Tiger Lake 8 core CPU with lots of power to spare? To put this in perspective, I owned an Intel HEDT 7820x 8 core 16 thread CPU. This mobile CPU outclasses that desktop CPU by a significant margin in almost all tests. This CPU in this chassis performs extraordinarily well.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd by extraordinarily well, I mean the focus on cooling means this CPU performs beyond what it does in lesser chassis. With 6 heat pipes (see pictures) and Thermal Grizzly Conductonaut liquid metal TIM, this laptop pushes the boundaries of what the i9 11900H can do. I was able to consistently hit 5138 points in Cinebench R20, CPU-Z single/multi was 628/6040. Honestly, the H series chips have been plagued with chassis unable to handle their ferocious heat output. The ones that were able to were 2” thick. The GU603 is is a great chassis, because it is relatively thin and is handling the extraordinary power being used. While the 10900H does thermal throttle, it’s able to handle clocks approaching 4GHz under load on all cores. This combined with the speed of each core means you’re getting quite the processing beast without breaking your back or the bank. For reference, the GU603 came up on my scale at 4lbs 9oz.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the CPU is great - an 8 core 16 thread beast ready to slice through your video encoding jobs. But what about the GPU? Well the RTX 3060 is quite the piece of kit. It possesses a full complement of GA106 cores at 3840. This provides over a 30% uplift in performance from the already potent 2060 in the G14. Now other variants of the GU603 have the 3070, which is a big boost in performance. However, the 3060 is no joke, and almost as performant as a 2070 desktop card.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what really brings home the gaming experience is how both the CPU and GPU marry with the screen in question. The good news here is that Asus didn’t skimp on this display. At 2560x1600, the 16:10 aspect ratio is a welcome return from the pre-16:9 era. The panel is 165Hz, and lives up to that speed. The IPS panel has solid color reproduction, fast response, and a resolution that befits the 16” panel. You can use the screen at 100% scaling relatively comfortably, but the default 150% is a pretty good setting. The screen does have a bit of backlight bleed - common in IPS panels - but not too distracting in all but the darkest of scenes/games.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe display also features almost no bezels. These are even thinner than on the G14, but this laptop, unlike the G14, features a webcam. This edge to edge display does offer a tighter form factor. The M16 does indeed remind me much of my trusty old 15” rMBP. The screen however is definitely larger at 16”, and offers quite a bright picture - much brighter than the G14’s screen. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo it’s a good gaming experience, but what about a laptop gaming experience? Between the svelte formfactor, excellent RGB keyboard, and large trackpad - this is a great machine. The beauty of the M16 is that it isn’t caught up in gaming style - and just like the G14 before it, can function in a professional environment. The black color adds to the professional acetic. The RGB keyboard can be set to a static color via the Asus Armoury Crate software. Performance can be adjusted here as well, allowing for quieter operation in the office, or full workstation performance if desired. The fans can get loud on the M16 when pushing sustained performance. Thermal throttle is always the name of the game when dealing with Intel, but how far and fast it throttles are the differentiators. The M16 does a great job of keeping clocks high in those circumstances, and the firmware is tuned very carefully to keep clocks as high as possible which explains the performance consistency in this machine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe camera, wireless, and trackpad are all good, but maybe not best in class. The camera is about what I expect on a laptop. The trackpad is large, and gestures well - but seems overly sensitive out of the box. I’d find myself three finger swiping instead of two finger scrolling just because of a finger or palm wrestling on this large pad. The wireless is a MediaTek 7821 based chip, which is a decent 2x2 WiFi 6 chip. I was surprised to not find an Intel chip in there. The port selection is excellent - offering USB A, C, and Thunderbolt. HDMI and RJ45 basically mean you never need a dongle with you. The power brick belies the fact this computer is power hungry at peak performance. At 240w it's one of the most powerful bricks I've seen. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1TB SSD performs quite well, with peak read/write times over 3GB/s. There is even a second PCIe/SATA m.2 slot waiting to be populated inside. Also inside is a RAM slot that allows you to upgrade from the included 8GB chip to 32GB (total 40GB). The WiFi card is also accessible and upgradable. You can enter the back panel by removing 13 screws (1 is captive in the bottom corner, and 3 are hidden below small rubber sticky grommets). It easily clips off at that point.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe casing is a combination of magnesium and plastic. Part of the casing has a rubberized coating that shows grease pretty readily. The design is solid, and the lid is amazing. There is a metallic flex of color in the small holes that grace the lid, and make a subtle statement. Dedicated volume keys above the center mounted non-number pad keyboard. I applaud the center keyboard, as number pads just aren’t very useful in my opinion on a gaming laptop.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe GU603 is a great gaming laptop. The chassis takes care of the powerful hardware without making you stand out. This design capitalizes on all the great parts of the G14, and then adds an even more powerful CPU, GPU, and expandability. A top notch screen, and more than adequate keyboard, trackpad, and complete port selection make this equally a great workstation. I expect this will be a popular configuration at the price point it lives at. Great job again Asus.\", 'A great laptop, with some minor issues that can be addressed by Asus updates!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe screen:\\r\\nMonitor is fantastic, probably the best I have ever seen in any laptop monitor ever!! 16x10 aspect ratio!! Buys you more screen real estate for apps, especially helpful for programs like Adobe Premier, Adobe After Effects, and 3D software. This screen gets BRIGHT. You almost believe it is an OLED screen!! No screen tearing in games because of it’s high refresh rate. But, that big screen does probably drain your battery charge faster than a 16x9 panel might. The only thing I do not like about this screen is that for whatever reason, they decided to put the exhaust fans pointing directly at the bottom of the screen, and when you game it is blowing hot air directly at the bottom of the screen. Only time will tell if that heat while gaming, will affect the longevity of the screen, however there have been reports saying at full gaming load vs another Asus model released just prior to this, (g15) which shares the same chassis cooling design, but AMD based CPU, that they both have about the same heat at the bottom of the screen. Also, not an issue for me really, but there are 3 LED lights for the power state, drive activity, and network activity that are right under the screen, and reflect on the bottom of the screen. After a while using the laptop, I found it to not really be too noticeable.\\r\\n\\r\\nGaming:\\r\\nThe 3060 Graphics card is great for running most modern games. Even at native resolution, Doom Eternal and Wolfenstein The Old Blood ran fantastic. Doom Eternal, with most bells and whistles turned on ran at around 140 - 190 FPS.\\r\\n\\r\\nKeyboard / Trackpad\\r\\nGreat keyboard. It just feels nice in the hand! Very comfortable. Feels premium in the hand. While I do like how this laptop looks, it is a fingerprint magnet, and because of this plastic like coating, I suspect long term this laptop will pick up lint. Same with the trackpad.. Really nice feel to it. One of the best I have ever used.\\r\\n\\r\\nPorts:\\r\\nI really wish the power adapter plug in was not on the side of the laptop, and at the back. As it stands, if you work with it plugged in at a desktop, it just gets in the way, and partially blocks vents, and also some of the ports. Not a deal breaker, but if you are going to use this as a desktop replacement, it would just be so much better had the connection just been on the back of the laptop. For those that know what Thunderbolt is, because this is an Intel based laptop, it has Thunderbolt for super fast connections. Most windows people will not make much use of out thunderbolt, but if you are a video content creator, and need to transfer files, thunderbolt provides very fast I/O.\\r\\n\\r\\nSSD:\\r\\nWhile it is great that this laptop does support PCI E 4.0, something only Intel machines in the last few months have supported, the SSD with this laptop is only a PCI E 3.0 SSD. For most people, they will not notice the difference. The SSD is still really fast, and the computer just boots faster than any laptop I have ever used. Read and write speeds are also just really fast.\\r\\n\\r\\nWiFi - I wish this was better, just ok.\\r\\nMediaTek Wi-Fi 6 Wireless LAMT7921N Card - not good range, slow speeds over same distances compared to intel AX200 card in my Asus ROG G14. I only have full speed if I am very close to my router. I will likely replace the MediaTek Wi-Fi 6 card, with the same intel AX200 card I have in the G14.\\r\\n\\r\\nAudio issues - related to the WiFi card, only while on battery, and in “silent” mode.\\r\\nThere is some kind of audio crackling that only seems to happen while working on battery only, and while ARMORY CRATE (the asus software for controlling your CPU/GPU performance). It turns out a recent update has introduced audio issues. Users of this laptop have managed to pinpoint the audio crackling issues only happen while in the ARMORY CRATE “silent” mode, and are directly related the crackling (which happens on both the built in speakers, and also during headphone use, to the MediaTek WiFi card being put into a lower power mode, and it is what is creating the audio crackling. Other owner’s of the m16 have managed to fix this by modifying the windows 10 registry settings for the power state of the wifi card while in “silent” mode, however Asus should be able to fix this without owner’s having to do this. - Direct link to subreddit where people have identified audio crackling issues and temporary workarounds can be found at - reddit.com/r/ZephyrusM16/comments/oj2otl/audio_cracklingstatic_but_only_in_silent_mode_on/\\r\\n\\r\\nAsus, please fix the audio issues caused by the mediaTek WiFi card. This is a known issue, and while workarounds exist, this should be easy to fix!\\r\\n\\r\\nBattery life:\\r\\nFirst of all, while Intel has made some strides in this department with the CPU chipset in this laptop, it still uses a lot more power than AMD Ryzen laptops. I would never game with this not plugged into an outlet, but I only get around 5-6 hours surfing the web and very basic computer usage. If you need a longer life battery, any of the new AMD Ryzen laptop models will squeak out more.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, this is a great laptop. The single best thing about it is the screen. QHD+, makes is a 16x10 screen, and not the usual 16x9 QHD, and it adds about .6” of vertical versus other QHD laptop models It is a real treat to work, and to game on. Add to that, it weighs less than 4.5lbs and you really have a pretty portable powerhouse.', \"ASUS ROG 16 Specs:\\r\\nProcessor: Intel Core i9 11th generation H series (Tiger Lake)\\r\\nRAM: 16 GB memory \\r\\nGPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 6GB DDR 4\\r\\nStorage: 1TB SSD Pcie v4.0 \\r\\nDisplay: WQHD (2560 x 1600)\\r\\nThis Asus ROG 16 inches WQHD display with adaptive 156Hz refresh rate is a great gaming laptop; it is lightweight and performs surprisingly fast. Combining the 9th generation Intel core processor i9 H series (Tiger Lake) and Nvidea RTX 3060 provides an increased gaming experience besides handling the hefty workloads on PC. The prismatic film design in which colors barely shine through is sleek and modern even though the body is made of plastic, but it feels premium, and nothing is observed to be cheapy made. Thin bezels are remarkable, and the ergoLift hinge mechanism is smartly designed; when open the display, it would lift it further down and pushes the laptop up to allow better keyboard typing and better ventilation. Cooling system, I found that the hot air blows at the bottom part of the screen during a heavy gaming session. I checked that a couple of times, and it does nothing, but I wanted to share it in my review. However, I managed the fan speed on Asus Armoury Crate, but that compromised my CPU and GPU performance. Setup was straightforward, with few steps to finalize Windows 10 setup. The power button and fingerprint scanner are integrated, so both work together; I simply press and unlock your PC, which awesome. However, the integrated webcam is available for face recognition as an alternative method of unlocking the PC. Connectivity and availability of ports, this gaming laptop is powered by Wifi 6 that is all about speed in addition to Bluetooth v 5.2 1 HDMI v 2, Gigabit Ethernet LAN, 2 USB-A 3.2, and 2 USB type C, one of them is a thunderbolt, and one is power delivery, 3.5 audio jack, and micro sd card. Performance is outstanding, and at the time of writing this review, the regular use as an office laptop, it does work very well smooth and no lagging issue so far, but it stands out in gaming, the Core i9 H series processor and GPU RTX 3060 provide the next level of gaming, I play primarily 60Hz refresh rate online games, and for my one week of use, I honestly say this laptop handles high graphics specs easily and performs very very well and did not notice any delay or lag or screen tearing. I like the adaptive sync technology as GPU and display sync variable refresh rate based on what is on the screen even during gaming like in my Tom Clancy's The Division 2. The standards are 60 fps, but this drops to 35fps based on the graphics rendering need. Keyboard keys are well-spaced, and RGB lighting is awesome. The trackpad is large and smooth. Asus Armoury Crate is essential to manage and create scenario profiles for using and customizing the laptop, such as keyboard lighting and fan speed for better cooling as needed. This useful software can be accessed from the downloaded apps, or the dedicated button next to the volume controls onboard. Dolby is equipped for having high-quality audio and video, Dolby Atmos built-in speakers, and Dolby Vision for videos. The speakers sound outstanding, and the mic is not quite noise-canceling capable as when I tested it with my friends, they still hear noise around me; nevertheless, the mic offers a good quality of voice compared to what I have on other computers. Overall, this Asus laptop is really great for gaming and everyday use; it's lightweight, super-fast, Liquid metal cooling system, multiple connectivity ports, sleek design with powerful hardware that handles everything ranging from gaming to office work.\", 'The ASUS ROG is a powerful machine built into a sleek case.\\xa0 In the box is ASUS, 16\" gaming laptop and charging cable.\\xa0 This laptop is fully outfitted to run even the heaviest graphics load by combining the Intel Core i9 processor, 1 TB SSD, with 16 GB RAM and the Gen 2 NVIDIA RTX3060 GPU.\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\nBuild: This laptop feels sturdy, but not so much that it\\'s bulky or cumbersome. The laptop lid doesn\\'t scream gamer, but yet a sleek, subtle presence with a unique refractive prism crossing diagonally across one third of the lid (see photos). The laptop hinges are solid, and the design makes the screen easy to open one handed. A unique design is how the hinges are recessed at the bottom of the laptop body, allowing the screen to open up with a space between screen and vents, opening beyond 90 degrees gives the bottom an angle above the flat plane, and allowing more air circulation, preventing the cloud of molten hot air you get with other laptop style cooling designs.\\xa0 Note: it still gets warm, and you can still hear the fans, but less so than many gaming laptops with similar specs. One feature I love, the laptop incorporates a fingerprint reader into the power button, making it a seamless boot up / sign in straight into Windows. \\xa0The keyboard is a good \"adult finger\" size, with a medium key travel that I prefer, and a large highly sensitive touchpad consuming almost half of the remaining real estate below the keyboard.\\xa0\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\nFeatures: Unique option to ASUS ROG laptops is the \"Armoury Crate\" button that sits at the top of the keyboard, next to volume\\xa0control buttons.\\xa0 This button brings up ASUS options and shows a radar chart of laptop performance based on cooling, noise reduction, energy savings, GPU performance, and CPU performance changing as you select the type of \"mode\" you want the laptop to operate in (see photo). From this control panel you can also change the keyboard backlighting and lighting style, toggle through graphics options such as racing, FPS, and RTS/RPG, profile keyboard layout configuration and a game library where you can tie the keyboard configuration to each game.\\xa0In addition to laptop settings, the external features allow for connectivity with HDMI, thunderbolt port, built in HD webcam, USB port, microSD reader, and a 3.5 audio jack. \\r\\n\\r\\nPlay: Now the important stuff, how well does it function? First, straight out of the box the user experience is top notch.\\xa0 The visuals on the 16:10 165 hz LED display are outstanding, and amazingly vibrant, even in full sun (see photos). The audio output is impressive for laptop speakers, and while I still use my headset, it\\'s more my preference than sound quality concerns.\\xa0 My first test of this laptop was to link to Oculus 2 to drive Minecraft.\\xa0 While there are still a few bugs on the Minecraft side, casting was seamless, and the 3d rendering was smooth, overall a visual feast for any Minecraft fan.\\xa0 Second I didn\\'t waste time with building up to it, but went straight to my heaviest graphics game, Final Fantasy XV, in which the graphics were seamless, zero lag / tearing, and performed as expected due to NVIDIA RTX3060 graphics driver. To note, this build isn\\'t all fun and games, but can also dress up for work and run a heavy processing load with ease. This machine out performs my work laptop in capability and will run a heavy database load in conjunction with rendering software faster than any other stock laptop I have tried.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, if you are looking to get into gaming, this is a great \"go for it\" machine that doesn\\'t require any hardware upgrades to get the job done. You can run even the most graphics intensive game as well as a (compatible) VR headset off of the stock build. This is also a great, does it all, machine if you need something for both work and gaming.', 'I am loving this laptop. The form factor is perfect, not that big, but not that small either. It feels sturdy and there is no flex on the keyboard. The outside has like a brushed ROG strix design and its very classy, nothing obnoxious. The screen is slim and its amazing, the resolution is 2560x1600 and with this size, the pixel density is amazing, everything looks sharp and clear. The refresh rate, ohh the refresh rate is 165 hz and its amazing, driving it is a RTX 3060 mobile GPU, which has ray tracing like its bigger desktop RTX siblings. I can get great FPS with modern games, even with ray tracing enabled, thanks to NVidias DLSS, and even if I am not hitting 165 fps, the screen has adaptive sync, it also has Dolby vision, it looks amazing with movies and games that have HDR!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CPU is intel’s latest for laptops. Doing some benches, its single threaded performance (matters a lot for gaming) is amazing, on par if not a little bit faster than AMDs latest Ryzen processors (CPUz bench gave me around 650ish for single threads). The laptop has an amazing thermal solution and a great piece of software that you summon up with a single press of the ROG button, next to the volume buttons. You can monitor your CPUs temps, GPU temps, fan speeds etc. While using it on my lap, without a power adaptor it never felt hot (the laptop defaults to power saving when unplugged). When plugged in, it defaults to max power and it did get a little hot and the fans where audible, however they were not obnoxious at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has plenty of io ports. One micro-SD reader, 2 ss USB type A ports, 2 type C ports (one is thunderbolt), one ethernet port, a full-size HDMI port and finally an audio/mic minijack combo.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe keyboard is RGB backlit, and the keys are your classic chiclet ones, they feel great for a laptop. There is not numpad due the size factor of the laptop. I am fine with it. The track pad is huge and super responsive.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is also a webcam on top, which has a good enough quality for video calls and meetings. This laptop is also windows hello supported on the fingerprint sensor, which is on the power button. A feature I love is that once you press the power button, it kind of saves your fingerprint and as soon as it boots to windows it logs you in automatically for that time (it only caches it for that session). Very convenient!\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want a very portable, powerful gaming laptop (you can do some serious work on it too, the screen is so calibrated that photoshop, premier work is possible on it) I highly recommend it!!', 'Most of the reviews are probably going to be focused on centered, and yes it\\'s a beast. So I won\\'t go into too much detail on that. I game on a larger 17\" lenovo laptop and work on a 16\" macbook pro. This machine hits the sweet spot between the two to where i\\'m comfortable replacing both with one laptop now. The Zephyrus has a very similar footprint to the 16\" macbook pro, though is a tad bit thicker, but fits in all the cases I had for the macbook. it\\'s also a tad bit heavier, but still portable enough to travel with. It has the same 2560x1600 resolution as the mbp, which since i\\'ve owned has spoiled me to the point to where i don\\'t enjoy working on a 1080p 16:9 res screen. now I have that in addition to the 165hz and a matte finish, it\\'s pretty much perfect... \\n\\nspeakers aren\\'t as good as the mbp but just as loud, and better than most gaming laptops i\\'ve owned. also apple\\'s trackpads are hard to beat, but asus has made a good attempt in the zephyrus using an oversized glass surface, it\\'s still really good. \\n\\nplenty of ports, no longer have to carry any dongles around. it supports 100W charging through its USB C ports, which means I can use my mbp charger.. do note that the laptop comes with a 230W charger. so if you\\'re doing anything cpu/gpu intensive while on 100W usb, it probably won\\'t charge the battery. works perfectly in my case where it\\'s low-power during work, so i can keep my usb charger there and the main charger at home. speaking of low-power, the battery life is flexible enough to where if I\\'m just using it on the couch at home for web browsing and watching youtube, it will last me the entire evening without any trouble. but don\\'t expect more than a couple hours of gaming at full power.\\n\\nsure it\\'s got an rgb keyboard and a bit of glimmer on the lid, but with the keyboard lighting off or set to white, you wouldn\\'t know it\\'s a beast of a gaming laptop, and is very unassuming on my office desk. be ready to wipe this thing down A LOT if you have clammy hands like me, it\\'s quite the fingerprint smudge magnet. \\n\\nit feels like it stays warm even in sleep mode, so i\\'ve been hesitant to have it sleep while it\\'s in my bag. however it boots up so quick that shutting down completely has not bothered me much.\\n\\nso far, very happy with my purchase!', \"The ROG Zephyrus M16 is an incredible gaming laptop. When I got this laptop home, I was excited to see if the performance would live up to its potential-- and it did! I am not exaggerating when I say, this is the best gaming laptop I have ever used. \\r\\n\\r\\nFirst and foremost, I was impressed by the specs. It is the first computer I've seen that was available with the 11th Gen I9, RTX 3060, 16 Gigs of ram, a 1 TB SSD. and a 16-inch 165 Hz display with 500 Nits of brightness. With Specs like that, you already know this laptop is going to be a beast. As for real world performance, below you will find my breakdown.\\r\\n\\r\\nBattery\\r\\nWhile gaming with maxed out settings I was able to get 2 hours of battery life. While performing daily work tasks I was able to get 8 hours of battery life.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisplay\\r\\nThe display is extremely bright, immersive and performed phenomenally. Games were buttery smooth; colors were vivid, and the picture looked solid.\\r\\n\\r\\nKeyboard / Trackpad / RGB lights\\r\\nThe keyboard and trackpad are exceptional. Every key press was comfortable, quiet and responsive. The trackpad is large, reactive and accurate. The RGB backlighting is bright and can be customized using the Armory Crate software. The only thing missing is that you cannot change the color of individual keys.\\r\\n\\r\\nCooling.\\r\\nThe fans are fairly good. They don’t get too loud and do a decent job of keeping the laptop cool. While playing games I did notice the area just above the keyboard getting hot however that can be expected of any gaming laptop. Also, I noticed that some people are concerned that the top vents are blowing hot air on the screen. It is not. The vents on the top are intake vents and do not exhaust.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith all that being said, this laptop gets my highest recommendation. You will not be disappointed.\", 'I have been using Gaming Desktops until now and looking for a high-end gaming laptop for portability. I got a ROG Zephyrus M16 GU603 gaming laptop. It has an excellent configuration to play any PC games. It comes with 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-11900H @ 2.50GHz 2.50 GHz mobile processor with smart eight-core, sixteen-way processing performance with Intel Turbo Boost Technology. The 16-inch WQXGA (2560 x 1600) 16:10 anti-glare display with a 165Hz refresh rate and response rate of 3ms boasts impressive color and clarity. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt has 8GB DDR4 onboard and an additional 8GB DDR4 SO-DIMM with a total of 16GB RAM for advanced multitasking and substantial high-bandwidth RAM to smoothly run your games and photo- and video-editing applications, as well as multiple programs and browser tabs all at once. This laptop came with 1TB M.2 NVMe™ PCIe® 3.0 SSD. Due to SSD, boot up is very fast and data access is instant. With NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ 3060 Laptop GPU With ROG Boosts up to 1525MHz at 80W (95W with Dynamic Boost) 6GB GDDR6 dedicated video memory for a fast, advanced GPU to fuel any type of games.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis laptop has Windows 10 Home operating system and weighs only 1.90 Kg (4.19 lbs) 5.5 lbs. and measures 35.5 x 24.3 x 1.99 ~ 2.23 cm (13.98\" x 9.57\" x 0.78\" ~ 0.88\"). This laptop has many ports 1x 3.5mm Combo Audio Jack, 1x HDMI 2.0b, 1x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A, 1x USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, 1x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C support DisplayPort / power delivery, 1x RJ45 LAN port and 1x card reader (microSD). It comes with a 720P Built-in HD webcam with a microphone for video calls and office calls. The keyboard is Backlit Chiclet Keyboard RGB and the colors are beautiful while playing games.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Smart Amp Technology, Audio by Dolby Atmos, AI mic noise-canceling, Built-in array microphone, 2x 2W tweeter and 4x 2W woofer with Smart Amp Technology, the sound quality of the speaker is great. Streaming, recording, and gaming are streamlined with the Zephyrus M16’s multi-faceted audio system. Boasting Dolby Atmos® technology, twin tweeters and dual force-canceling woofers offer beautifully balanced acoustics, with Hi-Res certification that supports media at the highest fidelity. A customizable 3D Mic array captures audio in a variety of scenarios, while Two-Way AI Noise Cancelation clarifies sound from your feed and incoming feeds as well. \\r\\n\\r\\nWoofers produce low frequencies that define bass and help create a richer, more dynamic soundscape for your audio. Sounds at such low frequencies typically produce stronger, more noticeable vibrations. To minimize resonance in the smaller chassis, the Zephyrus M16 deploys woofers in pairs that are slightly offset to cancel each other’s vibrations. It came with ø6.0, 240W AC Adapter, Output: 20V DC, 12A, 240W, Input: 100~240C AC 50/60Hz universal. It supports Wi-Fi 6(802.11ax) and Bluetooth 5.2 (Dual-band) 2*2. With Fast Charging technology, 50% can be achieved in 30 mins. This laptop has 90WHrs, 4S1P, 4-cell Li-ion battery. Battery life is excellent for 10 hours of continuous usage.\\r\\n\\r\\nROG’s Intelligent Cooling philosophy mixes the right features and settings to ensure the best experience for each chassis. For the Zephyrus M16, the liquid metal compound cools the CPU. A customized self-cleaning 2.0 thermal module clears dust to improve long-term stability, while Arc Flow fans are designed to generate impressive airflow with reduced turbulence, ensuring powerful yet quiet cooling. ROG Armoury Crate unifies system and lighting controls to put essential settings and easily define custom profiles. From the security standpoint, there are several features like BIOS Administrator Password and User Password Protection, Kensington Lock and FingerPrint\\r\\n\\r\\nI have been using this laptop for a week now and played various games with an XBOX game pass. All games were working perfectly without any issues. It is running very quietly. I am really impressed with the ASUS ROG Zephyrus M16 GU603 laptop and it exceeded my expectations/ I am using it every day and can play any PC games even on trips as it handles everything without any glitch. This is one of the best gaming laptops in the market with outstanding specifications.', 'My first gaming laptop purchase. I’m completely satisfied with it’s performance. I’m already ok with 1080p display and 30 - 60 fps. Battery life is about 4 hours for regular use and drains fast when gaming so I suggest playing while it’s charging. It gets hot really fast and can be noisy but, I didn’t mind because I’m wearing earphones. I took a bunch of photos showing what it can do.', \"Pros:\\nLightweight (though heavier than advertised)\\nPowerful\\nExcellent display\\nGreat keyboard and track pad\\nLots of ports\\n\\nCons:\\nASUS build quality and My Asus software\\nFan tends to kick in sooner than other gaming laptops I've tried\\nPorts are all bunched up on one side and situated too far forward its messy\\n\\nI was in need of a Windows laptop and wanted something that was powerful, lightweight, and had an excellent display.  After doing some research online this seemed to fit the bill.  The first unit I picked up I returned as it creaked a lot while handling the screen and around the track pad.  The My Asus software also seemed to hang a few times while it was doing its updates.  The second one seemed to have finish issues, the vents in back seemed bent, and a little bit of creaking with the screen but  it wasn't that bad.  I'm comparing it to my Macbook and a Razer laptop so I am probably being too picky in regards to build quality. Its also a little bit heavier than the 4.2lbs they advertised as both units I had were at 4.6lbs  \\n\\nLaptop performance itself was great.  Could run multiple programs and browser tabs without hiccup.  Gaming was pretty solid.  Fan does spin up a bit sooner compared to other laptops - even just sitting there so I thought that was weird.  Played around in Armoury Crate but I didn't really figure out a good setting but I am sure you can tune it to the way you want.  Its not an annoying sound though and I didn't think it was too loud it just starts spinning when you don't think it should.  Laptop does get a bit warm when running games etc., but I would say its normal for a gaming laptop.  The display is wow!  Its vibrant, sharp, really bright, and the aspect ratio is great for productivity type tasks and web use.  \\n\\nI think for what you get in this laptop its a good deal.  I've also tried the G15 and while I like how the Ryzen version worked for games I think the display on this one is better and the ability to use Thunderbolt would place the ROG 16 above the G15 if you are looking for a laptop that you are going to use for more than just games.  It was a hard decision as I really liked the whole package but ultimately returned it though as I couldn't get past the overall build compared to other laptops I have been trying.\", 'I was looking for the Asus Zephyrus G15 with RTX 3060 but since it\\'s been out of stock for a long while I decided to go with the M16 because of the special $200 discount offered by BestBuy.\\nLet me start off by saying that this laptop feels really premium! The screen is one of the best IPS screen that one can get today on a laptop. I enjoyed watching videos & doing productivity on the large 16\" screen. The 165hz screen refresh rate make the overall experience very smooth even for normal tasks.\\nThe Keyboard & Track pad are also one of the best! It took a while getting used to the new layout (since I come from ThinkPad lineup), but once I got used to the layout it was a really a joy using it. Not to mention the smooth silky touch finish that the entire deck has to offer. Sweet!\\nThe speaker sound is quiet good for a laptop. Front facing speakers make a lot of difference.\\nI am not an avid gamer but I tried running Forza Horizon 4 & Apex Legends on the machine & it ran butter smooth. I was able to get around 100fps in Forza on all high settings & native resolution. \\nI am not worried about the fingerprints that shows on the device very easily, it needs regular cleaning.\\nThe Asus software experience is also very good & stable. Did not see any issues with this.\\n\\nTalking about the negatives: The laptop gets warm when running normal load on the top area & gets really hot when running games (with charger connected of course)!\\nThe fan noise seems loud when on heavy load.\\nFinally the battery life is very average. Even though the device has 90watts battery, I was only able to get around 5hr 30mins of max battery life with silent mode, battery saver selected & iGPU turned on doing productivity tasks that include web browsing, youtube videos & coding. That for me is really short compared to Ryzen based solutions. I was expecting more.\\n\\nOverall a very nice device, little pricey at full price, but battery life needs to improve. INTEL come on!!!!', 'This is an excellent gaming and personal laptop. I have used the G14 (3060) and the M15 (3060). This took all of them to a whole new level, Finally the new Intel chip and the 16” 16x10 display rocks. I am able to have Thunderbolt 4 and PCIE 4 thanks to Intel. The 3060 is a very competent graphics card. It came calibrated out of the box. So good n fact that my Spyder 5 made it look worse. The one thing that I did not like is the fans get loud and pushes heat on the display. In fact I am considering the GS protection to protect my investment. Really this ticks all the boxes except it would be nice to be able to purchase the version with the 3070 and 32gb of ram but that was not available.\\n\\nBattery life on the silent profile allowed me to edit photo’s in Adobe LR for about 3.5 hours which left me 25% before I shut it down. Only con’s are that the laptop can get warm. The rubber strip can dig in your knee’s for long use. Finally the heat is concerning on the display.\\n\\nI think this is the best balanced laptop for the money which is why it is currently sold out.\\n\\nAs a side note I do have the Flow 13.4 and if portability is more important then that still is a very competent gaming laptop.', 'The average user will never be able to push the Asus-ROG (Republic of Gaming) 16-inch laptop hard enough to demonstrate the power it has available. However, if you are a serious gamer (Destiny 2 or Gears5, not Candy Crush), or someone who needs Ray Tracing graphic power and an HD Screen to run Engineering or Architectural Design Programs like SolidWorks or Revit, this computer will give you years of use. If the Feature details below are too technical, you can just be sure they are VERY impressive especially for a Laptop.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFeatures:\\r\\n- Intel i9 11900h H45 10nm\\r\\n- Nvidia RTX3060 Series GPU with 6GB GDDR6 Ram\\r\\n- 8GB DDR4 RAM (+ 8GB on Board). There is a second RAM slot available for expansion.\\r\\n- 1 TB M2 NVMe, PCIe SSD (very compact, very fast, relatively cool running), \\r\\n- 16” WQXGA display with an automatically variable refresh rate up to 165 Hz\\r\\n\\r\\nPROS:\\r\\n\\r\\n- The NVMe hard drive gives bootup and game transition speeds that are amazing. The time from Off to the main Windows screen is just 13 seconds. It is equally faster getting through the boring transition screens in games showing for example a spaceship supposedly moving through hyperspace while the console or computer is processing the new scenery in the background for the next game level. This will save a lot of wasted time for serious gamers.\\r\\n\\r\\n- This computer has the required specs and ports to run Virtual Reality hardware and software and is compatible with HTC Vive, Oculus Rift and Windows Mixed Reality Ultra.\\r\\n\\r\\n- The Nvidia RTX3060 GPU with 6 Gb of GDDR6 RAM, the 16 Gb of DDR4 RAM (8 GB soldered on board + 8 GB stick in the slot) and the SSD described above, combine to make this a very fast gaming machine.\\r\\n\\r\\n- The 16” WQXGA (12560 x 1600) 165 Hz 3ms DCI-P3 display seems to outdo even these specs. I have played intensive shooters on other PCs and laptops and have never had a great experience because of difficulty discerning enemies (both NPC and human PvP) lurking in dark areas of the screen. It’s hard to describe but I think it’s the high color gamete that has so many colors that for example, an enemy in a dark grey amor can be seen against a dark grey background by being a slightly different shade of grey. It makes a world of difference.\\r\\n\\r\\n- As I’m sure you’ll see in other reviews, this laptop has all of the latest modern external ports you’ll need and I’d expect that for the price and category of this machine. However, what really surprised and pleased me was that it has one port of such an old standard that most laptops have dropped it. That’s the RJ-45 E2600 Gigabit Ethernet NIC. Gaming is all about low-lag speed and as fast as modern Wi-Fi is, you still can’t beat a wired LAN connection into the internet. My two-year-old high-end laptop’s manufacturer had already dropped RJ-45 to chase the laptop thinness craze. I had to buy an expensive dongle adapter for that laptop to go from USB-C to RJ-45 and lost the use of the USB-C port to do it. GREAT!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCONS: (Because, with Power comes Compromise)\\r\\n\\r\\n- This first “Con” cost the laptop one star. The start button is in an awkward location ~3 inches in from the top right of the main body. The awkwardness wouldn’t be that apparent if all the button was used for was pressing to start. The problem is that it is also the fingerprint recognition surface. That means you have to hold your finger at an angle not only suitable to apply the downward force, but also suitable to press all of your fingerprint onto the reader. I have lots of devices with fingerprint readers, but none of them are as poor at reading the print successfully as this one is. I’d go right to the PIN number entry if I could, but it has to fail reading the fingerprint first. I go through this frustration EVERY time I fire the Asus up.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Because I travel on business a lot, I turn the laptop on when I have even a short time to do some work between flights. For some reason Asus chose not to include a camera good enough to enable Windows-Hello facial recognition. This means that instead of coming to life as soon as you open the laptop and show it your face, you have to go through the tedious manual password typing startup. A better fingerprint reader would have helped some. \\r\\n\\r\\n- This laptop does not have a touch screen. I REALLY miss that when I’m using it for producing documents or searching the internet.\\r\\n\\r\\n- The matte surface REALLY shows fingerprints.\\r\\n\\r\\n- At the angle I use the keyboard at, I can see the LEDs that are supposed to only shine through the keys to light the letters up. The exposed LEDs are so bright, it makes it harder to see the letters which are dimmer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConclusion:\\r\\nThis laptop is designed for gaming performance with little or no compromises for more common use. If you just type emails and cruise the internet, it is unnecessarily heavy and expensive. But, if you’re a serious gamer or graphics user, then this one deserves your serious consideration.', 'I purchased this device for work. I am a professor and a medical researcher. I create content videos for medical education, as well as write research papers for publication. The M16 has an excellent vivid and bright screen with an accurate color gamut for reviewing CTs and cardiac echos. The keyboard gets heavy use, and the keys are very responsive and have nice travel. Unfortunately, I do not do any serious gaming on this machine, so I cannot write to that use. However, I can say it can handle anything you throw at it productivity-wise and not even blink. I put in 32Gb RAM (total 40), and I run multiple resource-heavy programs without issue. \\nThe fan noise has not been a problem for me. I run it in \"Manual\" mode with the fan speed set to 90% and power set to \"balance\" for 80% battery since I am almost always connected to the wall. The deck never seems to get hot, and the screen does not get hot by the intake vents. I read that was a concern, but my screen has never been more than mildly warm. One thing of concern was the top left-hand corner of the screen. When you grab the corner to open it, it creaks like it isn\\'t glued together very well. However, I have not had any quality issues with this device (knock on wood) outside of that minor issue.', 'Overall if you’re a creator first and gamer second I say this laptop is a 10/10! I use to carry a MacBook Pro for content work stuff but also carried a Razer blade advance around for when I had down time and wanted to game. I was getting tired of hauling two laptops and trying to find a backpack that can carry two laptops and a tablet plus accessories. When I this released it’s like a Jack of all trades but master of none. It’s a beautiful QHD 16 display and the i9 is a beast but the 3060 is better than the one on a Mac. I can still play most games at decent frames but mainly use Maya.', 'I bought this laptop for school with the purpose of using it as a gaming, productivity, creative, and engineering platform and I was taking a shot in the dark with this. I was trying to decide between a Gigabyte Aero 15 XC, Lenovo legion pro 5, and Razer Blade 15. There are plenty of things those laptops do great at this laptop really rocks whatever it does.\\nDespite stellar reviews in some places and more modest remarks in others, I did not know what I would think about this laptop. I saw this as having \"ok\" screen compared to other things and a smaller 3060 compared to the 3070\\'s that can be attained for this price point and it seemed to lack some other smaller things like full RAM slot customization (due to 16GB being soldered to the board)...but little did I know that this thing would be amazing.\\nTo start, this laptop has amazing build quality. No keyboard flex, minimal screen flex, and an aluminum lid account for a solid feel. The inner body is rubberized which means it smudges and gets greasy easily but that is a minor thing. The screen can clock to a refresh rate of 165 hz, which seems odd, but it makes everything look so smooth, and not to mention the quality and size of the screen is great (amazing color accuracy and brightness). This does not have a screen like the Aero 15 XC or Razer Blade but this is more than enough to please one\\'s eyes.  \\nHere was the selling point for me: the 11th gen Intel i9-11900H. This processor obliterates creative app benchmarks and is amazing for strenuous work. Other laptops that have this processor are at least $200 more expensive. The drawback that comes with this is that it is a power-hungry processor which greatly impacts battery life but there is no such thing as amazing battery life with a \"gaming laptop\". Pairing this processor with the screen, the 3060, the 16gb of ram, and the fast SSD just allow this laptop to be a beast. Not to mention, ASUS\\'s armoury crate software allows for tweaks everywhere and is very useful for performance. I have no complaints about this laptop; even the fans are very managable and not obnoxious and it has not gotten very hot on me, despite me putting ridiculous loads on it. \\nNow for this price point, this laptops sibling, the zephryus G15/14 should come to mind. Both are laptops built on the same platform, but the G15 has a ryzen 7 5900 which is no where near as power hungry and has better battery life but cannot squeeze out as much power under load as the i9.\\nAll around, this is an amazing laptop and I would recommend it if battery power is not a concern and that extra \"oomph\" from the  i9 is something that interests you.', \"On paper this is an incredible laptop.  Unfortunately when it comes to everyday usability it becomes pretty obvious that Asus is pretty clueless about a lot of things.  For example you can't have the FN key permanently enabled like on any other laptop.  Here you have to hold the FN key along with the designated F key whenever you want to put it on mute or to change the screen brightness.  There's no way around it.  Trust me, I've looked.   \\n\\nThe funny thing is that all other Asus non-gaming laptops have this option!  How does this make any sense?  Such a glaring oversight that makes this laptop a pain to use.   To add insult to the injury this laptop offers you the option to disable the Windows key as if that was a more popular request.\\n\\nAlso, the otherwise beautiful screen has some of the worst light bleed I've seen in my life.  From what I've heard it's pretty common.  The bleed is from the panel getting pinched by those tiny bezels.  \\n\\nSome bugs too.  If you switch the fans into the silent mode the audio starts to crackle.   There's a home-brewed fix for it if you're comfortable with editing your registry, otherwise good luck waiting for Asus to issue the official fix.\\n\\nThere are a ton of positives about this laptop too, but for nearly $2k it's not polished enough.  I think Asus needs to take a break from growing their market share and focus on quality control as well as user experience.  They're beginning to get a bad reputation.\", \"Over all, the ASUS ROG M16 Gaming Laptop with Intel Core i9 does perform well. I had no issues with playing games, but there was some inconsistent performance. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn games like Far Cry I got 80+ frames per second, as well as in GTA V. In Red Dead Redemption 2, I could barely get 60 fps. The RTX 3060 is solid, but if you don't need Intel, the Ryzen variant may perform better and more consistent, at a lower price tag.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe screen is amazing, as well as the keyboard. I have no complaints about the hardware either. It is definitely the slimmest gaming laptop I've owned. I actually am using it now for work and play. Wish it came with Windows 10 Pro, and not just the Home version for compatibility with some applications.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all, I love the laptop. I just feel at the price point, an AMD model may be a better option for some, for gaming purposes.\", \"This laptop is great, the screen, trackpad, everything is awesome; however, there are some concerns about it. Quality control is the same as the G15 (it's bad). The top edges bezels are loose, and you can hear the click sound when pressing it (the same issue as the G15). The bezels around the webcam area aren't firm. Finally, the keyboard doesn't register when pushing on the left and right edges. So far, these are my top concerns. Buyers, please be aware!\", \"The original laptop that I received had a faulty screen. While gaming, the screen would disconnect and sometimes wouldn't turn on for 10 minutes even after restarting the laptop. Thankfully, BestBuy was fantastic about returns and replacement. Just a 20 minute phone call with support and I had a new laptop on its way. The new laptop is running great and considerably quieter and cooler than the previous. Therefore, I assume that the problem on the original laptop was the panel overheating and shutting itself off. Since the new one is working fine, this can't be from the thermal design where the hot air is vented onto the screen, which was a concern at first. Seems to be more of a quality control problem than design. Overall, I'm impressed with the second laptop I received and BestBuy did an outstanding job with customer support.\", \"So far I'm really enjoying this laptop. Granted, it's been 4 years since I had my last laptop, but this way outshines it even thinking back to my old laptop's original performance.\\n\\nThis laptop is fast and smooth for almost everything. I originally purchased a g15 and had some issues of it not performing to a good benchmark (and also some wifi problems). I've had absolutely no problems with the m16 in the three days I've been using it. It's connectivity is great, its file transfer speed it wildly fast, so far its been a beast for productivity (it doesn't even break a sweat in my tests with photoshop and premiere), and of course it is crystal clear, absolutely smooth gaming.\\n\\nThis is the third gaming laptop I've tried as a replacement for my old one, and there are some key features that have made me want to stick with this one. The build is amazing! It has a webcam (really g15?!), a great screen, amazing speakers, off the chart thermal control, and feels great to carry and type on.\\n\\nBy far my biggest negative is the fans. They ramp up at WAY lower temperatures than I think they need to. When I tried the Razer Blade 15 (which by the way also really wants to keep the temps down), those fans still let the CPU and GPU reach higher temperatures than my m16 (so far at least). The other downside with the fans is often they'll click on at a decently high speed, and then go very quiet for a while, and then click back on for a hot sec again. I think the computer has thresholds where it starts to quickly ramp up fan speed, but the fans are so powerful they then quickly cool the computer down, and so they shut off again. This is pretty wild to me. In all my testing I've yet to see my CPU go above something I'd consider too hot, but the fan speeds can kick up and become loud.\\n\\nAnyways its a great computer, but I wish it handled its thermals with a different strategy.\", 'very impressive gaming laptop, it has handled every game i played on it on ultra settings and still keeps decent fps, games like gears 5, battlefield 5, and forza horizon 4. the screen is excellent with mild black light bleed. i added a extra ssd and more ram in my laptop and it performs excellent, my only issue was it was very hard unscrewing the screw needed to install the ssd to the point that the screw will thread. i had to use needle noise pliers to get it off but it worked i have no idea why it was so tight, one of the other reviewers noted that so i knew what to expect when i upgraded. overall i am very happy with my purchase and i am sure i will be for years to come.', 'I\\'ve been in need of a Windows laptop for my college engineering classes and I can easily say I could not be more satisfied. The M16 has been amazing, especially the display. I LOVE having a pretty light and portable machine that has a giant 16\" display. The 16:10 aspect ratio is wonderful for getting work done and makes movies and games pop.\\n\\nThe performance of the laptop is no slouch either. I\\'ve been wanting to get into PC gaming for a long while now after being a lifetime console gamer. I can say I\\'m super excited to play games on this machine and the bit that I have already been able to play is great. The i9 and 3060 combos in this blow right through anything I\\'ve thrown at it. The laptop does get quite loud under heavy loads but I can easily live with that when I\\'m getting the performance available to me. The speakers are quite good, get pretty loud, and don\\'t sound tinny or muffled. The keyboard is nice and tactile and provides easy and responsive feedback, allowing me to get into an easy typing groove.\\n\\nOverall, I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a great combination of gaming and productivity performance. I\\'m for sure going to be using this as my all-in-one machine for my college classes and gaming.', \"I had purchased the Asus W16 to replace my 2016 Dell XPS 9510 because I wanted something that can also play games with a more substantial graphics card but wasn't going to break my budget. After much research and watching YouTube review videos, I decided to settle on the Asus W16. For the price and the specs, it's a great deal and even better if you can get it discounted from its retail price of $1849.99. Ultimately, I ended up returning 2 of these units due to faulty QC on the screen with major backlight bleed land IPS glow. I know this isn't a Razer build quality but at least do a better QC on the quality of the screen because I know I don't expect OLED blacks but at least some kind of uniformity even if it's IPS. Other than 2 disappointing units that ended up being returned, the computer itself is great specs wise! Honestly, if you're going to purchase this unit, prepare to play lottery especially with the screen!\", 'I give asus 5 out of 5 for the design. This is the slickest laptop. Unfortunately the battery life is less than the amd g15. I value battery a lot that is why i took off 1 star. It also doesnt have hdmi 2.1 or mux switch. However because it is intel, it has thunderbolt 4 and faster pcie4 for ssd. M16 also has a brighter dv screen. I dont like the single  solder ram. Not sure about long term affect of hot air on screen. Maybe asus can add a vapor chamber but not increase price too much in future. I will like to see this design on future g14 & g15', 'Comparing it with the 17 inch core i7 Asus ROG strix N53SV that I replaced .. slower boot , touchpad defective from get go (still not fixed) , lots of flickering (switching to battery / opening a program) , periods of unexplained high GPU processing with sound of fans \\n\\nWanted it to be better but it didn’t meet my expectations (for the price tag of $1850/-) .. but I am pretty happy with the form and feel , it is lighter and better performs good , display is crisp and sound is awesome', \"In my search for the right laptop, I'd considered many options. I'm a student studying GIS, so I needed something relatively powerful that wouldn't be too horrible to lug around outside. That narrowed my options down to the Dell XPS, Razer Blade, or something out of the zephyrus line. As crazy as it may seem at first, this actually presented the best value of those options, with similarly spec'd competitors being significantly more expensive. The laptop has been great thus far, easily surpassing my gaming needs (all I play are strategy titles and MMOs), and it's been a joy for daily use: you really can't beat this display.\", 'Overall, this is a great laptop. I don’t run overly demanding games and the 3060 handles them like a charm. The display is gorgeous and the CPU is blazing fast.\\n\\nHowever, there are so many QC issues. I’ve had about 4 different models, and all of them had some sort of problem, ranging from minor ones like slight backlight bleed to software malfunctions out of the box and a loose trackpad. I eventually settled for one with slight backlight bleed and coil whine, but I wish it would have worked out differently. Would have been 5 stars if I didn’t have to go through this whole process.', \"OMG, this laptop is a beast. I'm sooo glad I waited for the full 11th Gen Intel to come out. This model has the RTX3060 in it too. A little tweeking needed out of the box like switching from performance mode to windows mode for the graphics, no more loud fans. It now auto changes to the RTX once games are started up now. It feels so liberating to have a super fast windows machine. I can play Cyberpunk on Ultra settings, even ray tracing on ultra/insane. I can play Gears 5 too much faster and better than on Xbox. Well worth the money, all in one powerhouse PC and gaming machine. VR ready too. You wont be disappointed.\", 'Great laptop. Very fast. Amazing screen resolution and frame rate. Only problems i have with it are the fingerprint reader is junk. It wont recognize my finger 9 times out of 10.

The bottom part of the trackpad is a little loose. BUT there is no quality issue for trackpad, just not good like mac. Keyboard is excellent, good travel. I know many people concern the venting issue. But I used it for 2 days and I am sure there is not issue for that so do not worry about heat air will blow the screen. Next issue is the top bezel of the screen is a little loose. It does not matter if you dont care and it will not affect anything.

They\\'ve struck a fantastic balance between price, power, and portability, with very little compromise. As you might have guessed already, I\\'m a fan!\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\\'s start with the design. Aesthetically this is one of the most attractive laptop designs there is. Beginning with the unboxing - the M16 (yeah that\\'s kind of odd to say in a tech review) is raised upwards towards you in an almost angelic fashion as you lift the the box lid. No, this has nothing to do with performance, but it\\'s just the first sign of the attention to detail that has gone into this laptop. Immediately you are presented with a simple and uncluttered machine, with clean lines and smooth transitions all around. I really like the machined holes in the lid that have a reflective inner lining which displays various colors at different angles. Again, nothing that impacts performance, but yet another detail that sets this laptop apart.\\r\\n\\r\\nLifting the device out of the box you\\'ll notice there is some weight to it. It\\'s not the heaviest, nor is it the lightest, coming in at just over 4 pounds. Understand though, this is a 16\" gaming laptop, chocked full of incredible hardware, so the weight is actually quite good for its class.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are plenty of ports including ethernet, thunderbolt 4 x2, HDMI, MicroSD, USB, and headphone jack. I particularly like the layout and placement, which is yet again another sign of the thought that ASUS put into this design. While all ports are along the sides and moved forward to the front of the device, which is good in and of itself - it\\'s the placement of the individual ports that I really like. For example, the power is the most rear of the ports which keeps it out of the way of other peripherals, while the headphone jack is the front most port.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with the design is the material. I don\\'t know exactly what the material is on the deck, but it is almost a rubber-like substance. While it does pick up smudges, prints, etc. it also easily wipes down. But what I appreciate the most is how comfortable it is. It\\'s almost like having a built-in wrist rest. This, along with the non-sharp edges makes for a pretty comfortable gaming experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince we are talking about the deck, let\\'s move on to the keyboard. This is an RGB keyboard which can be setup with the built-in software to display a near endless color variant experience. I would have preferred a multi-zone setup, however, this keyboard feels awesome to use. Not overly sensitive, yet also quite responsive. The trackpad is large, responsive, and works very well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe deck is lifted up from the rubberized footer on the underside. This allows for excellent heat disbursement which is drawn from under the chassi and pushed out through the top. I haven\\'t owned this long enough to know whether that heat output will eventually effect the screen, but it is something to be mindful of. The fans do become quite loud, however they do a more than impressive job of keeping the laptop thermals under control.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow to the screen. HO-LY CRAP is this an awesome display! Yes this is a 165hz WQXGA 16\" display with a 16:10 aspect - and is it ever gorgeous. But the really impressive part are the bezels - or should I say the lack thereof! These bezels are impossibly thin all the way around, and by far the thinnest I\\'ve experienced on any gaming laptop. So this is where a bit of magic comes in. Yes, this is a 16\" gaming laptop, however, due to the thin bezels it fits in a 15\" form factor. It really is impressive. Oh, and there is a built-in webcam. Now this is far from the best webcam on the market, but the fact that it even fits in the bezel is amazing. The webcam is also not Windows Hello compatible, however there is a fingerprint sensor which works incredibly well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe six speaker system puts out some impressive sound. I do prefer to use a headset for gaming, but for general everyday use these speakers are more than good enough. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo onto the inside. This laptop is a beast, handling everything you can throw at it with ease, rivaling some desktops. The Intel i9 paired with 16GB of RAM and the NVIDIA RTX3060 makes for some of the best gaming ever experienced on a laptop. Between the ROG software and the NVIDIA software you can customize just about every aspect of the internals with multiple profiles. Gaming is just so, so good! A beautiful clean screen, crisp visuals, smooth transitions, and an immersive experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nBattery life is highly dependent upon the settings, use case, etc. Obviously running Turbo Mode with high-end intensive games you\\'ll eat through the battery. To be fair - you really should be connected to external power when gaming so battery life during gaming isn\\'t a fair benchmark.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis ASUS ROG Zephyrus M16 handled everything I threw at it with grace and ease. For everyday use this is more than you could ask for. Multiple browsers with multiple tabs, multiple programs, video playback all running simultaneously and this laptop just laughs. Gaming performance is the best I\\'ve ever experienced. No lag, no drag, excellent internals, comfortable use, plenty of ports, webcam, 16:10 ratio, beautiful screen, I mean come on - what\\'s not to love?\\r\\n\\r\\nI highly, highly recommend the ASUS ROG Zephyrus M16. By far the best gaming laptop I\\'ve ever used. With features, internals, and design that exceed its price point you can\\'t go wrong.', 'I like the idea of it but it just doesn’t work as I expected. It has a very bright screen, great color RGB. The speaker is good. But I hope we have a 3070 version of it', 'For my workload I needed a laptop that was fast, thin, light, good quality, bright screen, and had a webcam. This laptop delivered or even overdelivered on all of these qualities. Luckily I did not have any of the quality control issues that Asus is now notorious for, so really this has been a stellar device for my needs. The only real worry I have is the vent facing the bottom of the screen, but I hope and assume that the Asus engineers left that design there intentionally, so I think this laptop will last me well past a few years', \"I managed to get mine open box for a really good price. I bought a 4k monitor and a stick of 32gb ddr4. I wish I could replace the mounted ram, but I'm happy with the purchase nonetheless and it's not worth docking a point for.

I only had a few problems with it. \\n1: the backlight bleed. It's not the worst, but it's pretty bad. \\n2: the material. I don't know exactly what they made it out of, but it's almost fuzzy. It's super hard to clean, especially after a long gaming session and your fingers/wrist are all sweaty. \\n3: the cooling. It's an Asus product, it's bound to have bad cooling. I'm getting like 70°C in a game menu. (Warzone main screen, right before you enter a game. You know what I'm talking about.)This has caused me to set the fan to ultra, which is kind of loud unless you have headphones in. They also have a fan blowing hot air right onto the screen. I haven't had any problems with it yet, but I don't know the long term problems of this.\\nIt is also worth noting that in multiple benchmarks, it couldn't identify the graphics card as a 3060, and I got horrible scores. I can, however, run AAA titles on max or high graphics so idk.\\n\\nI know it sounds like this laptop is garbage, but I'm just writing things to consider when buying it. The PC runs so smoothly on every game I own, which is a lot due to the 1TB of storage.

I like the idea of a gaming laptop so that when I travel, I can take my gaming / media device with me. I am not as savvy as others when it comes to the technical vernacular within the PC’ing community. Or the intricacies of why one iteration of a certain whatever is so much better than another. I am not ignorant though and do however understand what is important and this Zephyrus has what is important. I am a recently reconverted PC player. I was a PC gamer in the ninety’s and early 2000’s but switched to PlayStation and then XBOX products from 2010 – 2018. In 2018, I got my first gaming laptop of the modern era and dabbled but only last year with the release of the new XBOX and PlayStation did I decide to almost solely go PC. This is a common theme currently with a lot of the credit to rejuvenation in PC gaming coming primarily from the cross-platform play offered in Call of Duty Warzone. Being that I am a CoD enthusiast and avidly play Warzone it made my transition back simple and seamless. I was playing WZ on the XBOX One and with the release of the next gen models, I was honestly like why should I buy a new console when I can play the community games, I like on the PC I already have that rival the next gen consoles, even being a couple of years older. From there, experience taught me that the computer ran some games well but that the Nvidia GTX 1060 running on an i5 was just not enough anymore and that I needed more for my needs. The Zephyrus is great, and I can easily tell that I will be able to get a few years out of it before any upgrading is needed. \\r\\nFirst off, the presentation of the ROG Zephyrus is tre chic and has a prestigious vibe. The exterior is a flat matte rubberized black with an almost translucent RGB dotted spread spectrum graphic on the cover. The ROG startup continues this trend with a super satisfying intro sound. The ASUS Armoury Crate is one of the coolest features because it allows a novice such as me to really be able to do some important tweaks to get the most out of the unit. Of course, the first most valuable of this is being able to adjust and play with the RGB features of the backlit keys. The keys are a soft membrane key but make the grade. I use a controller when I play WZ but mouse and keyboard on everything else and I have had no issues with the feel. I will note that I prefer the crispness of a cherry keyboard when I type so I do use an external keyboard to do so when available. There are several available ports and even thunderbolt for us HUB users. \\r\\nNext and arguably the actual best part of this laptop is the “Near-Rimless” display. I have four screens on my desk and without even adjusting any color settings the Zephyrus’ screen is the best. The display folds back 180 degrees in what is called an ergo-lift. The two cool aspects for this are that the screen actually lifts the bast to allows for more air flow and when used with a laptop mount stand the unit can be better utilized as a dual monitor. \\r\\nAfter the outside the inside is where I will get super out of my element and just talk at a couple of points. The audio is amazing and impressively loud as opposed to any other laptop I have ever owned. Now this might be needed because this thing will get loud when the fans kick on. The laptop gets ridiculously hot, especially when using the Armoury and turning the performance to Turbo to really rock the top end of the in-game frame rates & rendering. The battery life is just not great when using the Nvidia 3060, but I did figure out when switching back and forth between the intel graphic processors and the Nvidia when on battery life it does extend it significantly. This is probably what I will do when working and not gaming. Aside from that though to truly experience the computer I feel like it needs to be plugged in and it is really more of a desk top alternative than a go anywhere laptop. As for the spec and processors again, this is what I know. In Battle V the game looks amazing on the highest graphics setting. In WZ you are capped at about 6k of VRAM and to get the highest end you will tap the red bar out and get the warning. I have yet to have any issues running it wide open like that and live streaming simultaneously. I will say get an external camera. The built-in webcam is 720p but just looks grainy. Watching any media is an absolute treat as well.\\r\\nI do have one real concern that only time will be able to really tell on. That is the quality of the manufacturing. The display is very thin and almost feels flimsy. It just worries me that it will require a ton more TLC than a normal laptop. \\r\\nOnce more, I do not know much but I do know bigger is better. So, I get a kick out of telling people that I have a 11th Gen Intel Core i9 – 11900H @ 2.50 GHz with a Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU GDDR6 @ 6GB.

In my time with this device, I can indeed confirm that it performs extremely well as a daily-driver for work and admirably well as a gaming laptop.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I\\'ve been plagued by repeated crashes. Like every 48hrs. And it\\'s not just this unit as I\\'ve returned one already and it\\'s doing it on this new machine as well. Constantly. \\n\\nBasically, without rhyme or reason, it simply shuts down and gives me a \"driver_irql_not_less_or_equal / entryptotect.sys\" BSOD.

Then after restarting it a few more times, things suddenly just start working again. I have no idea why.\\n\\nI\\'ve done the reading and I\\'m aware that this may have something to with how this wifi card interacts with my router. That\\'s even though we have 7 other devices (4 of which are computers) that have used the same router without issue for over two years. It could also supposedly be a third-party app I\\'ve installed. That\\'s even though I have the exact same apps on this computer as every other computer I\\'ve used over the past year and not a single one of them have had issues.

Guess I\\'m just lucky. \\n\\nI\\'m aware that I could spend hours trying to adjust my router, emailing someone at Microsoft, going in in-person to Best Buy, or putting in a full-on repair request with Asus. I know because that\\'s what the MyAsus website told me to do. But you know what? I just don\\'t have the time to spend hours and hours trying to fix a brand-new $1900 computer.

The other reviews made me think this was a great buy but turned out horrible for me.', 'Incredible gaming performance from a laptop that is lightweight and portable. To start, the presentation of the laptop is really neat. The box is designed so that the laptop raises as you pop open the box lid, creating somewhat of a really nice display. I was really impressed by how Acer put the time, not just to build an incredible gaming rig, but into the box and presentation as well. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne feature that impressed me at the beginning was the biometric unlock feature where the sensor is built into the power button. When I was setting up the laptop, I was instructed to place my finger on the scanner and was thinking, \"where is the scanner.\" I looked at the power button, and lo and behold, there it was. Although stunning, it is a bit disappointing at the same time, as it no longer recognizes my fingerprint, even after cleaning it. As for looks, the ASUS - ROG 16 has a simple, yet sleek design with an exterior that simulates a perforated look. One thing that I really like about the ASUS - ROG 16 over my Nitro 5 gaming laptop is that the ROG 16 has a much brighter display that is easier on the eyes. It also has all of the ports that you would need from a gaming laptop and micro sd card reader. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn to the gaming experience. The ASUS - ROG 16 has been able to keep up with just about every game that I have thrown at it. It\\'s fast and has so much adjustability for gaming performance through its Armoury Crate software. To make things even better, the MyAsus software makes connectivity so much more convenient, as I am able to stay connected to my ASUS - ROG 16 laptop via my cellphone. Battery life is also pretty incredible for a gaming laptop. \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, the ASUS - ROG 16 is an incredible gaming laptop. I am blown away by its performance, and would definitely recommend the the ASUS - ROG 16 gaming laptop to anyone!', 'if there is below one star i would give its the worst laptop ever\\n-Overheating even when u dont open any game \\n-back light bleeding \\nthe design really bad that made heating coming out directly to the LCD what make the lcd more bleeding \\n\\njust dont buy it', 'Just got my M16 3060 version and after 5 hrs of use, the laptop will not power on.

There was a vertical line of dead pixels that appeared five minutes after booting it up. Returned it with in an hour of having it delivered.', 'This Asus ROG Zephyrus M16 Gaming laptop seems like an incredible laptop to have for gaming. The sound is clear and crisp (not too loud, but I preferred this), and it sounded like surround sound when characters were talking in a game. The keyboard is backlit (RGB, changes colors, Fn+F4 toggles mode), and getting used to the keyboard seemed easy. The only thing the keyboard is missing that I\\'ve noticed so far is a print screen key (captures screen) but there are other ways of accomplishing that. For easy and secure sign in there is a fingerprint sensor, if you can\\'t find it, it\\'s the power button, just tap the finger on it rather than pressing it in. The laptop is also VERY fast, the whole system responds quickly. \\r\\n\\r\\nI did not yet open this laptop up (i.e. to get inside of the cover), but I was so happy to see it appeared to be open-able with a philips head screwdriver. This will be useful when I\\'m ready to do upgrades, such as If I need to expand memory or the storage. I will note other brand laptops I\\'ve owned recently don\\'t let you open the laptop without special tools.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was one point where I had bluetooth issues (controller was disconnecting and headphones were cutting out) but a few minutes later it was working fine, so it was probably not a hardware problem -- most likely either it was a software issue or maybe wireless interference.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter I played about 10 minutes with the first game tested, I exited the game and when I closed the laptop lid, It was obvious that the system fan(s) had gone up to a higher speed, as evidenced from the fan volume. But during gameplay, it was not very noticeable. The game had very high quality, fast moving graphics, and a frame rate on average that was between 70 and 110 fps (it did go higher and lower at times). To give you an idea of what that means, I\\'ve read the human eye can see between 30 and 60 fps. Going much higher might not have any useful effect.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother game I have that was a couple of years old played at WQHD resolution in \\'Very High\\' (highest setting) and was \"at least\" 60fps when I checked it. There was one battle scene which I had been stuck at, but on this laptop I lasted much longer and got further in the game than I previously achieved. Basically, for me gameplay was \\'easier\\' with this laptop. One small additional note, there were definitely more details in the game and menus that I did not even see on my Desktop which also had an Nvidia card from 2 years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best part is that I \\'can\\' play games on this laptop, I used to have to go to the desktop (in an inconvenient location) if I wanted to play, which meant often I didn\\'t bother before.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have intentionally not mentioned the name of the games I have tested in order to avoid reviewing the games themselves. They were selected because they were more graphics intense games and I could see how well the system performed with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nI tried taking this laptop outside, where the wireless connection is a bit weaker, but whereas my phone and older laptop had no issues connecting, this laptop seemed to be unable to acquire a network connection in my network configuration from outdoors. In the time I have to do this review, I cannot troubleshoot the issue much further than this, but suspect maybe a weaker antenna. The other possibility is I was unplugged from power and maybe a \\'wireless power savings\\' somewhere was enabled, but I could not easily locate it. I won\\'t hold it against this otherwise fun and beautiful high performance laptop (which I would recommend if you want a portable gaming system).', 'Returned it.

Keyboard clicks feel good and the Aura function for the keyboard backlighting can be configured to backlight many different colors. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the 16:10 screen, its nothing short of spectacular. Its got a 165Hz refresh rate and its great for gaming, video streaming etc Brightness, contrast and blacks are great as well. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is also an HD Webcam at the top of the screen for video, and included are 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD HD.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow to gaming performance, I must say I couldn’t be happier, the game rendering takes every advantage of the spectacular screen, unbelievable frame rates, and sound from the 6 speakers, just adds to the experience.

Well, I will cut to the chase and tell you right up front that if you are considering this gaming laptop don't give it another thought, just buy it! For more detail as to why, keep reading ;-) \\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, a little background. I have owned a handful of gaming laptops. All were pretty decent but lacked in one way or another. Sometimes it was the build, sometimes the screen, the memory, ect.. But, I always felt that was just the trade off you get by trying to make a laptop a gaming machine. The Asus ROG is the first gaming laptop that I've never felt like anything was left out. \\r\\n\\r\\nBuild quality. Feels very sturdy and has a nice fit & finish. Love the soft touch surface. Keys are nice and have just the right amount of travel for my taste. The large track pad works very well. All in all, no complaints on the build and it feels like it will last. \\r\\n\\r\\nScreen & audio. The screen is honestly the nicest I've ever seen on a gaming laptop. It's right there with that fruit companies Retina displays. But, it of course has the 165hz refresh rate. Yes there are machines out there with higher refresh rates. But for one you will pay dearly for them and two, do you really NEED more than 165Hz? I know I don't. Colors and sharpness are beautiful. No bleeding or bad angles. Plus, it's a matte screen to keep glare down. Always my preference. As for the audio, it sounds great to me. Six speakers with Dolby ATMOS. What more could you want? Wouldn't mind it if it went a bit louder but it's not a deal breaker. Normally going to have it plugged into some external speakers anyways or I'll be using the headphones. I can't say much about the noise canceling microphones as of yet other than to say I haven't had any issue with them. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the other specs, well, it's pretty well loaded. i9 with the RTX3060 is going to allow you to play anything you want. So far, I haven't had a single issue with maxing out every game I've thrown at it. I'm sure it can be done by some big time hardcore gamers. But for the 99% of the rest of the gaming world you will do just fine. The 16gb RAM is so far proving to be plenty. I was expecting to want to ad more right away, but I think I will wait and see if I even really need it. 1TB SSD is nice. So many laptops (even gamers) these days come with 256-500GB. Mostly because they expect you to really only keep your operating system on it while expecting you to use external drives the rest of the time. You can certainly do that with USB & Thunderbolt ports. But having plenty onboard is awesome. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the rest, the built in fingerprint reader is in my opinion an absolute must on any laptop these days and the one here works great. Battery life has been good so far (95 watt power supply) but honestly, who really games on battery? Most will keep it plugged in while gaming. There is room for an extra RAM stick but as I mentioned before, I'm not sure you will really need it. Ventilation seems good. The kickstand design allows for decent airflow underneath. The top vents dump out hot air just below the screen. Not sure yet how I feel about that. Don't know if it will have any long term effect on the screen (I doubt it) but as of now, no issues. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, if you want to use this for just about anything else it will work great for that as well. I do a ton of photography and with the latest & greatest high megapixel cameras, gaming machines work great for photo editing. Between the RTX3060, the i9 chip and the amazing screen, you can easily make this your go-to photography laptop. So far, Photoshop, Lightroom and Capture One 21 are running very smoothly. The fact that the external design is somewhat muted helps make it not stand out in a more professional setting as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo keep it simple, you will not go wrong with this laptop regardless of your needs. It truly is the first laptop I can say goes toe to toe with my desktop. It is everything I have ever wanted (or needed) in a gaming laptop!\", 'Awesome laptop, I love it but screen bleed is terrible and customer service is the worst.', \"I can say this is a really solid build from Asus if you're looking for a mid spec gaming laptop. It does everything you'd need to play many of the games you love and will hold its own in most scenarios.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe build of the laptop is outstanding. It feels well put together, it's compact and not to heavy. The hinge is smooth and will sit at any angle. The pixel looking case is unique and not overstated. Overall very impressed with this build and really shocked how slim they made the frame. \\r\\n\\r\\nPerformance is pretty awesome. By no means is this a top of the line rig. If you want that you'll need more money do look elsewhere. The overall gaming performance is great though. I didn't see any frame drops at decent settings. The keyboard is very responsive and easy to use on any game. The screen is what really blew me away. The refresh time on this 15in screen is like nothing I've seen, it really does look amazing. \\r\\n\\r\\nI'm really pleased with this rig. It is the perfect mix of performance and portability. If you like to game on the run or need a PC that doubles for school and gaming this is a great choice. I've had quite a few rigs in the past few years and this by far is my favorite.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few other little today bits I really liked were the RGB keyboard that just looks cool. The plethora of ports from USB A to USB C are great. I love that you can charge with the included power cable and if needed a USB C charger.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou really can't go wrong with this rig as a portable gaming rig.\", 'I was so excited for this laptop, but the display was DOA - dead pixels. Returned.', 'So I received my ASUS ROG 16\" WQXGA 165Hz Gaming Laptop and have been putting it through it\\'s paces over the last week. For me this gaming laptop has turned out to be one of those items that you never knew you needed until you got it.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst off, hats off to the ASUS R&D team for the design and build quality of this device. And I\\'m not just talking about the internals (which are nothing to shake a stick at). But the sleek design and sturdy build quality, I knew that this computer was going to be a beast. The design is something that I\\'ve not seen in other gaming laptops that I\\'ve tested in the past. And one of my favorite features right off the bat popped up during the initial setup process. It asked me to do a fingerprint scan as one of my Windows logins. Initially I was a little confused because when prompted to place my finger on the scanner I honestly did not know where the scanner was located. Then I barely touch the power button and that\\'s when I realized that the fingerprint scanner had been built into the power button. This amazed me beyond anything. I was like, \"how clever is that, it\\'s built right in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter finally getting everything from Windows downloaded, installed, and updated I tested out a couple of games that are very graphic intense and was immediately impressed with the beautiful display before more. The graphics were simply amazing and smooth. There was no lag whatsoever as my character moved from one area of the screen to the next. I also did not notice any blur effects that I have seen on other subpar \"gaming laptops/devices.\" And the colors seemed to pop a little more for me on this device. The one area I did initially have issues with was the sound. With the volume cranked all the way up it seemed as though I wasn\\'t getting loud enough sound; that was until I found the Armoury Crate program that allowed me to tweak this ROG to my hearts desire. This made me love the device even more. I was able to tweak the settings with the program to up the volume even more as well as change the keyboard lights to different colors to how they fade in/out, or to just make them static. Also in the Armoury Crate program you can set laptop into different modes depending on what you\\'re currently using the device for.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis laptop in my opinion is top-notch and ready to tackle any game you can throw at it as well as convert back to that laid back device you need when it\\'s chill-time. And last but not least this thing boots like superfast thanks to the 1TB SSD. It\\'s like you press the power button and boom this thing is ready to go.', 'This ASUS laptop plain and simple is a BEAST. It is overall the sleekest and most well thought out computer I’ve ever owned in my 20+ years of PC ownership, period. Go Buy It NOW!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Asus laptop comes in a very nice box that actually props the computer up as you open it (kudos for that nice touch). I did notice other than that there wasn’t much in the box other than a power supply, but honestly there doesn’t need to be. Setup was flawless, did all the major updates and graphics card updates and was ready to go in about 30 minutes. Out the box this thing is a supercomputer. Using CPU benchmark I hit UFO status on all three bench marks and ranked in the 95th percentile for computers everywhere. The Asus interface for changing settings inside the computer itself is intuitive and easy to use. Once switching to performance and Turbo mode the computers performance really started to shine even more. I love that they have the ability to configure your computer how you’re using it at the time to best suit your needs. Asus is really right on the thumb of what gamers really are looking for in a computer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe screen is gorgeous and almost completely edgeless, its bright, and shows great shadows while playing FPS’s and probably better than any monitor I currently have in my home. Playing Microsoft flight simulator for the first time made me want to cry a little, it was so gorgeous. The laptop handles any game you throw at it with ease and then some. Apex legends looks way better than even my XBOX ONE X. With a 1tb ssd, ninth generation i9, along with the 3060 its a legit powerhouse combo that can’t be matched anywhere else, ESPECIALLY since its portable. The fact that all of this power comes in a laptop is ridiculous. The Dolby atmos speakers are phenomenal as well. I’m a huge music guy so the sound is incredible, any video or playing any game the laptop sounds like it has complete surround sound, its unreal for a laptop. The fingerprint scanner is a nice touch and the keyboard is one of the best I’ve ever used EVER.\\r\\n\\r\\nI literally can’t say anything bad about this laptop. It is the epitome of what a computer should be. The fact that you can have such a powerhouse computer in such a sleek and portable design is amazing. I would highly recommend this computer to anyone. Hands down the best PC I’ve ever owned and I will cherish this laptop for years.', \"Gorgeous display, great performance, excellent thermals (finally a laptop that isn't constantly thermal throttling) - this laptop is near perfect.  Was concerned the 3060 would be a little underpowered for the display but it holds up well and should be able to do 60fps+ with reasonable settings in the most demanding AAA games.\\n\\nThere is one flaw though - this model comes with a Mediatek MT7921 Wi-Fi 6 card instead of the much more standard Intel AX200...  and this card currently has issues connecting to various Wi-Fi 6 routers and access points.   Was able to work around the problem by changing channels or forcing the card to operate in 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5) mode but this is going to be a problem for those less tech savvy and when you don't have control of the Wi-Fi you're connecting to.  Hopefully new drivers can fix this but using the Intel AX200 would have avoided this issues.\", \"This is an absolutely fantastic gaming laptop. Let's just get right to it. This thing has great performance. I was able to play many modern games at high settings and get really great performance out of them. Graphics are definitely above last gen systems such as Xbox One and PS4, and are maybe on par or better than Series X or PS5. And just for everyday computing, it's pretty lightning fast as well. It starts up and is ready to go in seconds. Everything loads super fast thanks to the ssd. It's only 1TB, so I kinda wish it would've been a bit larger. I'm sure after a few months of installing games, I'll really want another TB or two. The screen is beautiful, and buttery smooth at 165hz. And the bezel is paper thin. They fit a 16 inch screen in the form factor of a 14 inch computer. Absolutely ridiculous. My old 15 inch gaming computer is a good inch and a half wider than this system, and at least 2 pounds heavier. It's a bit mind boggling how much performance they were able to cram into such a small form factor. One thing that bears mentioning is that this is indeed a high performance gaming machine. And as mentioned, it is a relatively small form factor. Along with performance comes heat. When playing games on this system, do not expect quiet. The fans kick on and they can get pretty loud. There's just no getting around that. If you want high performance, you're gonna have to deal with heat. And in a laptop form factor, that's gonna be with high speed fans. That being said, it's not a big deal, and just throw on a pair of headphones and you're fine. Overall, this is just a fantastic gaming computer that can handle any current game, and at pretty high settings. And it does so in a very nice, slim form factor.\", \"Overall this exceeded expectations. I got this laptop for my wife to replace both her previous laptop and her current high-end desktop. The RTX 3060 does a great job of keeping up with modern games at the laptop's resolution. Handles all gaming, work, and design needs perfectly. It is compact for the amount of power it has and relatively light too. The screen is just amazing. I have no regrets on this purchase, even paying full price (something that I tend to avoid as much as possible).\\n\\nShe is using this laptop in the house (docked to a mouse, keyboard, two monitors, etc.), in her work studio, on the go, and everywhere. \\n\\nA couple things to note: \\nYou can find better specs at this price point. They would come at the cost of a couple features and build quality. In this case, I find those to be very much worth it.\\nThe laptop does run loud when plugged in and gaming. Not annoyingly so, but loud enough to notice.\\nThe battery life sucks when gaming... but I have yet to find a good gaming laptop without that issue.\\n\\nI would highly recommend this laptop.\", \"This is a very nice computer. It's extremely fast for downloading and uploading videos. The Graphics are crisp and clean with beautiful visuals!\\nDepending on the use of the computer, I see only a few dislikes, as the keys seem smaller than on other computers that I have had and are a bit closer together.  They are lower than any of my other computers, but that is just something to get used to. I love that the keyboard lights up!\\nI was disappointed there isn't a number pad, but since it is able to Bluetooth I am just using a portable number pad for when I am working.  I could have gotten a different computer that had one built-in, but my son insisted on the higher processor and newer graphics card.  \\nI do like this computer and feel it's a great choice.\", \"Awesome looking screen. The fans don't seems to affect the screen so no worries there. Lightweight and portable, very nice looking. Battery is good though not Ryzen-levels good.\\nMy only 2 complains would be that a RTX3060 is not enough for QHD gaming so you lose on the screen benefit. The other complain is that it can get quite loud.\", \"It's a beast, the quality of the the design and features are above and beyond, it's case and hinges are resistant to wear. It comes equipped with everything you need out of the box with minimal to no useless programs and apps. Fans are nice and quiet, however it will get loud when pushed to work, but then again most PCs do anyway. I expected nothing less from ASUS as they seem to always deliver. I was hesitant to order from Best Buy, but they had my laptop ready for pickup within a week!  when other stores kept delaying my order. They will definitely be my first choice in the future\", \"This is a really great choice for a creative or business minded user who games on the side. The 165Hz 16:10 QHD calibrated 100% DCI-P3 display is crisp and beautiful. If you've never seen a high refresh display, this display will blow you away.\\n\\nThe i9 in this laptop is one of the best you can get, and paired with the Nvidia RTX 3060, you can basically throw anything at this computer. Unlike it's older sibling, the 2021 Zephyrus G15, even though they are the same dimensions and weight, it has a web camera and a taller display, filling in the bottom bezel. The color is also much closer to black than the grays of the Zephyrus G14 and G15.\\n\\nOne star was knocked off from the laptop due to the fans. It's not as insanely loud as the G14, but with the very power hungry (but capable) i9, the fans have to work much harder than if this was running a comparable AMD 5900HX.\", \"This laptop has so many little things that just put it over the edge. From something as simple as when opening the lid, it raises the laptop from the desktop to improve airflow. I use to roll up Velcro wire ties to make short legs to hold my old laptop off the desk surface to improve airflow. I have seen some people use a pen or pencil under the laptop to get a little extra airflow\\r\\n\\r\\nThe glass trackpad is so nice. It is large and very precise. I for one have never been a fan of track pads, but this one is excellent. I actually use my mouse less, only time i reach direct for the mouse is when I am in game.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe keyboard is chicklet style, and is really quite comfortable and has great travel on the keys. It is very easy to type on or use for game input. I still use my mechanical keyboard, but if I am away from my desk, I don't miss my keyboard anymore. The backlight is adjustable. I only wish you could do individual key color assignments. I like my WASD red. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe screen is stunning. The more square profile makes for a 16 inch screen in a 15 inch laptop. There is almost no bezel. Somehow they still added a very respectable web cam at the top. The 2560x1600 resolution/format is beautiful especially at 165Hz.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerformance in game is at a desktop level. I am currently running 2 monitors along with the internal display. I have yet to find any games that stutters or lags. Most of the games I have been playing are racing games. GRID 2019 runs silky smooth. Other games like Paradise City Remastered (with webcam disabled for apps in settings | privacy | camera), Trackmania, Project Cars all run effortlessly. Games like Civ VI and No Man's Sky are absolutely stunning. \\r\\n\\r\\nCooling is fantastic. The fan is not silent, but the cooling is really impressive. The only way it could be better is if it was liquid cooled. When running hard, the fan is loud enough to be heard. If you use headphones you will never notice it though.\\r\\n\\r\\nPorts are plentiful. There is a micro-SD card reader. The USB ports are 2 standard USB ports and two USB-C ports. One USB-C is Thunderbolt 4. You can do a charge through the port with a USB C cable in a pinch. The brick is required to run at full power, but it is great to have an option. Additionally there is a full sized HDMI port and ethernet jack.\\r\\n\\r\\nWireless is really strong. I have had no issues with connection and speed is as fast as my router allows. Now I need to find a Wi-Fi 6 router.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not think I can heap enough praise on this laptop. Asus has added very little in the way of free ware that clutters a new machine. The software they have added is very well implemented from fan and processor controls to system and driver updates. I am very happy to be back on Asus hardware.\", 'This is my first gaming laptop. I have a gaming desktop but it is pretty old. I needed a laptop for school and wanted one that I can game on as well as take out without it having that gaming aesthetic. This laptop performs well and looks nice and slick. It is portable with enough power to play any game I want. The included webcam was what sealed the deal in choosing this laptop over another.', 'I test drove this and the 15\" Asus and decided to keep this one. The build quality is much better and the screen is very impressive, I love the ratio and brightness. I use the laptop mostly to run content apps and a little gaming. This thing is a power horse. I was concerned about battery life but tested this on Silent mode and was able to get about 6-7 hrs with light-medium use. Heavier workload in silent mode might get you 4 hrs. It has fast charging so you can get about 50% of your battery charged in about 30-40 mins using the power brick. I usually just use my 100W to charge it and that works perfectly. The fans can get a bit loud in performance/turbo mode if you really need to crank it up but in silent mode its super quiet and fully able to run my apps without any performance derogation. Keyboard is great. Very comfortable rubber material that support my wrists however its super annoying to clean the thumb prints. Thinking I might get a skin cover to cover that up. Otherwise, I think for this is an all around perfect laptop for those that have a need for performance in a portable laptop.', 'So far so good, only had for a week but its working better than expected for gaming. If i had any complaint it would where the screen sits behind the vents in the back. The bottom of the screen can get a bit warm and also maybe the lack of games that support the screen size due to the odd 16:10 shape but that was my choice.', 'With the chip intel i9 the performance of this computer is great. I love the 16 inch screen, the colors are wonderful. The only thing is that the fans can get a little loud because of performance.', 'I’m impressed. This thing runs Forza Horizon 4(turbo mode on, ultra) at 90-100fps at native 2560x1600. It’s insane! I love the screen! Only issues— a bit hot, not a big deal(80-85c while gaming, 50c idle) and I wish the cpu had been amd for battery life’s sake(8hrs). I give it a good A. This thing beats any similarly priced macbook up and down on power and especially ports, without sacrificing too much thinness. This laptop rides the line of gaming and portability. I tried out the G 14, but this is the one I’m taking to college I’m taking to college in the end.', 'Although I\\'ve only had this for a bit under a month, I have loved tons of things about it. First of all, the track pad is magnificent. It\\'s smooth, accurate, and delightful to use. Pair that with the 165 Hz refresh rate screen and it\\'s even more delightful to glide your cursor around the screen.\\n\\nThe heat intake vent in front of the screen was the largest concern for me to purchase this laptop, as many were concerned that the vent wouls blast the lower end pixels of the screen. This is not the case, however, since it is an intake vent. I cannot see this harming the screen, even after years of use. So, in my opinion, it is nothing to worry about.\\n\\nThe power of this computer rendered and exported a video I created in less than 2 minutes, which my gaming desktop would have taken around 10 minutes to do. I am very impressed by the computing power of this computer and if you switch it into Turbo mode, your computer will blaze through any task.\\n\\nThe keyboard is easy to get used to, with nicely lit (1 zone) RGB backlighting that I have matching my desktop wallpaper. It looks very nice. For me, the selling point was that the ROG 16\" has around 500 nits of brightness on its screen, as well as it being a QHD display. My previous college laptop was amazing, but was far too dim (at around 300 nits) for outside use. With 500 nits though, outside use is a breeze!!\\n\\nThe overall feel of this laptop is a durable, powerhouse of a laptop. Great for any user. I would highly recommend.\\n\\nPlus, if you try it out and dislike it... you can return it. I\\'d say give it a shot. I didn\\'t regret it when I did.', \"For an 11th Gen CPU and only a 3060 in it, this thing outperforms my desktop easily. The display ration 16:10 really needs to be the standard, makes the laptop seem bigger than it is. Along with that, its an awesome panel for gaming. Overall this is great, I just can't give it a 5 because it doesn't spec up to a 3080 AND the cooling is noisy despite being efficient. The temps were nice and low on relatively decent ultra settings on CP2077/control but the fans are loud and whiney. I don't mind loud but if it was lower frequency whine it'd be more tolerable.\", \"Very nice looking computer and super powerful. It is almost perfect, although it has some drawbacks which I would expect to not be present at this price point. Mine's speakers sound weird when on silent mode unplugged from charger (it kind of crackles). Also, there is a bit of backlight bleed, although it is minor and I don't really mind it because it is only noticable when the screen is completely black and on a high brightness. Other than that, it is really nice feeling, has an awesome keyboard and also runs pretty cool. The screen is amazing too.\", 'First off- this laptop is beautiful and sleek!\\r\\n\\r\\nFor us gamers we want to know can it run it? Well I’m here to say yes!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis laptop is loaded with an i9- 3060 GPU and 16GB of Ram. \\r\\n\\r\\nGaming on it was a breeze- COD on max Graphics was just shear gaming heaven! Slide over to Doom - just wow 165hz buttery frames and graphics that just popped!\\r\\n\\r\\nI was pleasantly surprised how every game I threw at this laptop from WoW to LOL and Apex all preformed flawless at amazing graphics fidelity!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boot up time was 2-4 second thanks to it 1 TB ssd!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is worth every penny! Asus-ROG has created a masterpiece gaming laptop!', \"The M16 is a perfect laptop for a content creator who also games. the 16:10 ratio screen is bright, vibrant, and accurate. The performance for demanding apps and games is amazing. The keyboard is really good. The i/o is refreshing and it's pretty thin and light for what it is. I'm giving it 3 stars because of poor QC from Asus. This is an expensive laptop and this is my third unit - the other 2 have had terrible backlight bleed. The unit I ended up with still has bleed but not as bad.\", \"I was deciding between this laptop and the G15 but decided to go with this one since it was in stock and the G15 was not. I wanted to use this as a college laptop meaning battery life is very important to me. In fact, battery life is what initially drew me to the ASUS Zephyrus line of laptops. On this laptop, I got between 5 and 6 hours of battery life with daily usage with all of the fancy stuff turned off (high refresh rate, brightness at 50%, integrated graphics, etc.) I wasn't really satisfied with that since my goal was 8 hours so that is one of the reasons I ended up returning it for the G15. Another issue I had with the device was severe backlight bleed. The panel itself is amazing but in low light, high brightness environments, it is extremely noticeable. The corners were all yellow and parts at the top and bottom of the screen as well. The performance was great as expected but I think it's a better bet to go with the G15 for better battery life as the AMD R9 series of chips is much more efficient than Intel's latest i9 series.\", 'First thing that stands out are the visuals of this laptop.  The resolution, colors, and thin bezel, 16:10 design is nothing short of exceptional.  In regards to performance, it will not be the best and highest performing laptop you can find, but it has held its own and stills gives me a very desirable gaming experience.  For bigger, triple AAA, open world games, I have had to tweak the graphical settings like shadows and ambient occlusion to help keep gameplay above 60 frames consistently.  \\n\\nI consider it to be a very well balanced laptop as  I enjoy a bit of gaming at more than sufficient performance levels, but also love the higher end of visual aesthetics.', \"To start off, my first ASUS laptop purchase was the G15. On arrival I immediately noticed some quality control issues. There was tons of creaking throughout the device even when simply grabbing onto the device. My first unit came in with a dead pixel and significant backlight bleed. I returned that product and bought myself an M16. This time the device felt really sturdy. Minimal flex and creaks; overall a good feeling device. The problem this time is the coil whine. When the laptop is on battery, you can hear a distinctive high pitch ringing. It typically came from the charging port and I found it very annoying. When charging, the coil whine gets a lot quieter but it's still there if you listen closely. If your work environment is loud then you probably won't hear a thing, but if it's quiet, you definitely will hear it. There was still backlight bleed but it wasn't too bad. Also, the spacebar didn't register my click if I were to click the bottom half. I returned the M16 and got myself another. This time the quality was really bad. As soon as I opened the box I could immediately tell that the screen was bent. Out of the box the display didn't lay down flush against the bottom side of the laptop. The creaks were awfully relevant too. Just even opening up the display you could hear the creaking. The backlight bleed was quite bad. Bad enough to where it actually blew out the colors while in real day use. Coil whine on this device was worst than the first M16. Instead of a high pitch noise, it made a static buzzing noise which was even easier to hear. I returned that product and again, got myself another M16. This time I wasn't surprised to find the same issues I had with all my ASUS products. Coil whine, backlight bleed, and creaking; although this time, this device wasn't too bad as the last. My main gripe with my 3rd M16 was quite significant. When I looked inside the heat pipes that vent out hot air, there is a black cord that stretches across the entire vent. One section of the cord actually looked like it was burned and you could see the copper. Although I don't know what the cord is for, it definitely wasn't suppose to be like that. The device would also just freeze for some reason at random. I've already gone through 3 ASUS device before this one so I knew this wasn't normal. When the device froze, everything would stop working. Even the fans turned off and the laptop would get insanely hot. I update all drivers and windows update so it wasn't a software problem. I finally returned that product yesterday. BestBuy is great and the people there understood my gripes and was able to work with me. Their return policy is really generous and I'm grateful but come on Asus. This is ridiculous. I really like the size and performance these devices give out, but I can't justify spending around 2k for faulty laptops. This can't be bad luck as I've been through 1 G15 and 3 M16s. This had to be the quality control that Asus has and it's really bad. For those who got good devices I'm happy for you but my experience has been just bad.\", 'The computer has an excellent design, but here’s the deal with the computer. It has a decent amount of storage, super light weight, but the computer over heats and die quickly at time while playing certain games.', 'I have been trying out multiple different kinds of laptops, trying to find the perfect one for me and I finally found it. This laptop has the most beautiful screen I’ve ever used, an amazing typing experience, great power and speed, and they fixed a lot of the things that Asus has not been doing well. They fixed the bezels, added a WebCam, and increase the keyboard lighting so that you can actually see your keys at night. Overall a great laptop or anybody who wants a powerhouse in a small package.', 'Loving this laptop so far.  The design is great can use fir work and gaming without people looking twice.  Had to tweak the fan settings but the asus profile set ups made that very easy.', \"Let me start of by saying that this laptop is designed excellent, everything about it I loved except one important thing. battery life. This laptop has very poor battery life and this is on basic tasks such as web browsing. Besides that, this laptop is amazing with its i9 11900H processor, RTX 3060 graphics, and 16:10 1440p screen, you get this laptop if you want power and an amazing screen for content creation, gaming, watching videos. This laptop is a powerhouse and I highly recommend if you want something that's going to get you through work.\", 'This is one of the best laptop I’ve ever had considering its price and specs. I do not have to give all the specs stuff since everything given by other reviewers already. This laptop is everything that I need. From editing videos, doing work loads, gaming… etc. It got everything I wanted. Asus did a massive overall game-changing laptop again.', 'This laptop has added so much to my work flow. The cpu performance is exceptional for what I do. I make music and the 8 core intel cpu does well. Also the screen is awesome. The aspect ratio adds so much to the build. It is a 16 inch screen in a 15 inch form factor which allows it to be as good as it is.', 'This is one of the best purchases i have ever done\\nThe laptop is very fast and doesnt have any lagging at all', \"TL;DR: I returned one of these and exchanged it for an identical one only to have the same exact problems with the new one. I returned it again, and I've used the return money to buy an entirely different laptop. Do not purchase this, the chance of getting a malfunctioning one is far too high.\\n\\nI read the stellar reviews that this laptop had and purchased it after the laptop that I had originally wanted sold out. It was a little bigger than I expected, but, despite all of the flaws it had, I do have to say that the picture and color on this are amazing, and it ran the games I installed very well. While actively gaming on this laptop, there were no issues at all. It was only when I unplugged the laptop to take around the house and do other things with it that issues arose.\\n\\nIt would frequently restart on its own despite needing no updates at the time, and I know this because I began checking for updates every single day just to make sure the issues I was having weren't because it was out of date. When it would restart on its own for no reason, it would also have a chance to reboot and refuse to recognize any networks that were around. It wouldn't just refuse to connect, it would say that there were none in general. This is impossible both because I have WiFi at my house which it had been connected to three minutes ago, and I live in the city where there are always options to connect.\\n\\nIn addition to the restarting and connectivity issues, it would also frequently freeze, and I would have to hard restart the machine. Waiting and letting it finish its tantrum never worked; I always had to hold the power button and restart it. Sometimes, when I would do that, it would also do the internet connectivity thing, so it would require yet another restart.\\n\\nWhen trying to watch YouTube videos, the audio would skip as well as the video. It was only ever YouTube, so I thought it was a YouTube problem, but, when I checked on every other device in the house at the same time, there would be no issues. I originally thought it was my earbuds dying, so I bought new ones, but the brand new ones also had the same issue.\", 'With an I9 and a RTX 3060 this laptop has all the speed and processing power I want for business applications and games.  A 1 TB SSD makes everything load near-instantly.  An all-around excellent purchase!', 'Amazing machine capable of gaming and productivity. The screen is beautiful and the graphics are stunning.']"

I just opened the box with HP Chromebook Touchscreen Laptop. I like it the size and just looking at Setup Instructions Guide. I'm excited about my first laptop purchase.\", 'This computer is awesome at an amazing price! It was on sale but even the regular price is still good.', 'I replaced and old pc and a slow laptop, I’m amazed how fast this new chromebook is, great buy for the price, go ahead and get one.', 'Good for basic surfing and web as chrome does.....', 'This computer has a great operating system and with the amount of ram provided it is a smooth running machine.', 'For the most part its done its job i wish the set up manual would have been a little more clear or more step by step explainatonM', 'I bought for my daughter on Christmas \\nAnd the screen went out after 1 month\\nLiterally after the return window closed!\\nWaste of $', 'Good size and its neat and cute, no disappointment.', \"I purchased this for a multitude of reasons, chiefly for its versatility of interaction. This is my daughter's first 'official' computer so, I thought it best to give her a wide variety of ways with which to engage the device. She is well acquainted with the touchscreen, trackpad use, and voice assistant but, the same was not true for the keyboard and mouse. I felt, at the time, this computer would give her a great crash course and I was right. The machine is quick and lively in its operations, it has ample storage space especially with the 100GB for a year free add-on, it's secure from invasive malcontents, and it's lightweight. To top off everything, it has been an excellent at-home compliment for her schoolwork; Her teacher and classmates use Chromebooks and Google Classroom for the vast majority of their lessons. Now if I could only get her to listen when I say to turn the volume down.\", \"I've had this for less than a week and love it. The touchscreen is awesome, the sound and picture are great. I can use voice remote to google things. It's really fast, easy to use, the keys are easy to type on and it has plenty of space for everything I need. It was on sale for $219, with a Best Buy $5 certificate and a $100 gift card, I was so happy to purchase this for $114!!!\", \"It's Awesome!! It's super fast charging, love the weight of it, the size of  14 inch  touchscreen is definately a positive upgrade. Very smooth aerodynamic keyboard. \\nBought a nice EcoSmart Targus case for it to store nice and snuggly. Very satisfied with this purchase as a gift.

I bought it for college and it is required that I use Microsoft in one of my classes. Other than that it’s a nice computer.', \"I'm new to Chromebook, so this is coming from a lifetime of Windows. I would say the transition has been pretty painless.  I was using Chrome and gmail on my W10 laptop, so that helped the switch.\\nI was able to set up a Canon D570 laser printer with NO problem - as long as the printer and Cbook are using the same SSID.\\nHP Chromebook:\\n1. Funky keyboard layout, which is to say that it has pretty non-standard key spacing.  I will be hitting the wrong keys for quite some time I expect.\\n2. Letters printed on the keys are unnecessarily small. Why so small - especially since the keys are not backlit ?\\n3. Screen brightness does adjust, but the contrast has no adjustment. Net is that the screen seems somewhat dim/washed out.\\n4. Screen resolution is not particularly good. Letters are a bit blurry, even after I searched around in the available fonts.\\n5. Battery life seems to be ridiculously good. Right now it's 90% charged, with 14 hours left !\\n6. Very light weight. Nice change from the biggies I've been lugging around for years.\\n7. Great response time.\\n8. Brought Excel, Word and PDF docs over. (Note: copy into Cbook was about 10 times faster than the copy out from W10 laptop, even using USB 3.0 port.) Was able to open legacy sheets and docs with minimal fuss.  Cbook Sheet and Doc programs are relatively primitive - think 40 years ago - but seem to be adequate for basic budgets, letters, etc.. Was able to print everything, including jpeg's.\\nConclusion: Simpler is better.  I'm not a gamer and I watch movies, etc. either on my tablet or TV.\", 'This turned out to be a premier buy. my mother wanted a laptop so she could write again and I wanted her to have a device that would work very similar telephone and tablets. In this case the Chromebook turned out to be a perfect choice. This particular model was one of the least expensive ones that had a touch screen. As usual, the employees at Best buy were more than helpful obtaining this product. I highly recommend this particular model.', \"I absolutely love this chromebook. The easy on makes this a real wow factor. No bugging me with constant updates. The battery is the best ever. If you're looking for a PC to just be on the internet and do simple task, this is the one. It being a touch screen is also a plus.\", 'First off, this review is for Model 14-CA061DX (with the touch screen). It seems that some reviews for similar models get mixed up.\\r\\n\\r\\nI haven\\'t had the Chromebook very long but I\\'m not seeing the same main issues others have stated. Some complaints don\\'t seem to be related to the product\\'s functionality either.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo to get to it:\\r\\n\\r\\n1) Operating System: This is not Windows. Don\\'t expect it to act like Windows or Microsoft products running the same on the laptop. Word works fine. There is a learning curve if you have never used a Chromebook.\\r\\n\\r\\n2) Printing: I get the frustration but it works perfectly IF you have a Google Cloud Print Ready printer. I\\'m familiar with Chromebooks as my wife has one and we ended up buying a new printer. Our old Brother laser was awesome but also was 7-8 years old and it was not compatible with Chrome OS. Overall the \"classic\" printers are very rough if not incapable to connect to from Chrome. Check to see if your older printer works with Chrome before you buy.\\r\\n\\r\\n3) Apps: Zero issues with running any apps. Netflix, Hulu, Spotify, Amazon Prime flicks, etc. Everything runs fine. I suspect some issues being more of your wireless network if you\\'re getting flickering (not to rule out a bad screen though). We get blurred pictures or lines on all devices occasionally as we stream everything. I do wish we could connect via Ethernet when at my desk all day.\\r\\n\\r\\n4) Keyboard: Well I\\'m used to a cheap keyboard as I\\'m still using an Acer Aspire One (6 years old). Time will tell with the HP Chromebook but it seems sturdy enough. If the cursor \"just randomly moves\" your palm may be coming in contact with the mouse pad. You can disable that and use a wireless mouse. No Delete or Caps Lock key is weird to get used to.\\r\\n\\r\\n5) Battery: This one I\\'ll come back to in a couple months to see how it goes. The way I read some of the complaints almost sounds like the reviewers got a refurbished laptop and that can be problematic. There\\'s a reason a laptop got returned and chances are it can\\'t be good. That said one thing that really irked me with the sales person is when he tried to sell me on the extended warranty. He kept pushing that the battery could fail in less than a year. I didn\\'t buy his sales pitch but was more remarkable is he said that new batteries could cost up to $300. A quick search online and I didn\\'t find an HP Chromebook battery more than $99. Most are $39-69. If you\\'re not comfortable changing a battery then the warranty might be worth it to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther than that:\\r\\n* Not having an HDMI port is a little weird but I didn\\'t use mine much except when traveling. I\\'d connect my laptop to a hotel TV to watch a movie.\\r\\n* I wasn\\'t looking for a touch screen because I\\'m not a fan of fingerprints all over the screen and this one shows them easily. \\r\\n* The screen looks fine and I like the size. I was originally going to get an 11 but happy I got the 14. \\r\\n* Getting 32 GB drive was a must. I will be adding a Micro SD as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, for $180 I\\'ll be happy with it as long as the battery lasts longer than a year ;-)', \"I'm 67 years old and have gone straight from home computer to this Chromebook and have not been disappointed.  Having avoided any of the laptop computers due to the price, mouse pad and the size; I finally decided on the HP-14 inch touch screen chrome book on sale during Christmas .  I don't use the touch-screen much but it works fine and I purchased a wireless mouse which works great!  The size is perfect for me.  I'm even learning to use the mouse pad and the keyboard is easy to use. This has been a pleasant transition.\", 'It has everything he needed.  This was a gift purchase for my brother who was convinced that he needed to replace his 8 year old computer with a new computer.  I\\'ve used an HP Chromebook for almost four years.\\nSo I purchased this HP as a gift for him with the stipulation that if he did not find that it \\'worked\\' for him, I\\'d keep it.  In two days he said:  \"It\\'s mine!\"  Why?  His comments included:   1) The touch -screen works well.  2)The 14\" screen provides ample room for \\'research\\' reading with additional open tabs. 3) The keys are very easy to type on with my large fingers. And 4) It does a whole lot more well, than just basic surfing.\\nHe has been \\'won over\\' and is making a HP Chromebook as his recommendation.', \"The HP chromebook is easy to use, easy to update and faster.\\nThe price is very good for its quality, efficient startup and shutdown and easy to use compared with my pc. \\n\\nSince it is a brand new unit, I must learn how to set it up, how to configure based on my needs and download the security software, etc. but found it's not difficult with the support from various resource.\\n\\nBased on these advantages, I am willing to recommend this product to my friends and families.\", \"Bought this for my wife to use at Preschool (don't worry, she's a teacher - not a student).  I unboxed it and set it up for her, and was very pleased.  Obviously, it's not a gaming computer and doesn't have the hardware to do video editing or anything, but for just internet use or Google Docs it's definitely done everything she's needed.  Excellent purchase for this price point.\", 'An excellent tool for communication, information gathering, entertainment, this HP 14-inch touch-screen Chromebook.  Fast.  My three-year-old HP Chromebook was damaged in an accident at home.  Best Buy had this unit in stock and I decided right away that I had to have it.  Thanks, Best Buy, for having this solution at the ready when I needed it.', 'I grew tired of dragging my heavy laptop around the few times a year I was away from my desktop to do things that I am only doing online. I researched the screen sized (wanted something a little larger), memory, touchscreen (needed or not), etc. This is a much cheaper alternative to getting a high end tablet with a keyboard and slightly more expensive than the smaller chromebooks out there (I needed a larger screen to see everything). I have been very happy with my choice thus far and though getting used to doing everything \"chrome\", I\\'ve found this to be a nice replacement for an aging laptop.', 'I got this laptop to attend lectures via zoom and that’s really the only purpose this serves me.

Seems like a lot of schools and even businesses are going to the google platform. not giving 5 stars because I can not see myself ever gushing over a chromebook.\", 'Bought as a bday present for my dad. He loves it so far.', 'It to bad easy to function for people not to computer friendly', \"I purchased this chrome book about a month ago. As a tenth grade high school student, my intention for this laptop was to use it to do school work, send emails, watch videos, and just use it as my first laptop of my own that I will hopefully be able to bring with me to college in a few years. For this purpose, I am very pleased with this product. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne of my favorite features of this device is the ability to access all of the google apps so easily and being able to use the google play store to download other apps that I am familiar with, as a smart phone user. My first phone was an Android so I know my way around the google play store, so it was very exciting for me to be able to download some of my favorite apps on my chrome book. Some of which, like the TED app and google photos have versions that take up the whole screen, as designed for chrome books. Some of which like Instagram and color switch only take up a cell phone sized area on the computer, but still work fine. Since this is a CHROME book, everything is run through your google account, which is really nice since with my personal google account and my school google account, I can access everything from my documents to my photos on any device from anywhere from just signing in to my google account. \\r\\n\\r\\nI also really like the touchscreen feature. Even though this laptop does not have the ability to go into tablet mode, it allows you to go back and forth from using the track pad to touching the screen using your finger. I have also purchased a stylus to use with this device for things like virtual white boards like awwapp.com which I have found helpful. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe battery life on this is great. Since I usually only use this device for light work for maybe an hour or two each day, I can go several days on a single charge. However, in just the month of having my computer, I have noticed that the percentage of battery life is slightly more rapidly declining as it once was. I also talked to a friend who has a similar HP touch screen chrome book and she said that after a year of having hers, the battery life went from 12 hours to about an hour, so that is a little concerning. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne of my favorite things about this computer is how much you can personalize it. I have it so my background changes from different art graphics daily, and there are lots of options for that. It also allows you to change chrome themes which is fun. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe webcam on this chrome book, well, exists. It would be fine for a quick skype call if this was the only device I had available, but with a choice, I would much rather use my iphone 6s for a video call as its camera is much better. \\r\\n\\r\\nNow on to the most annoying thing about this laptop, which isn't really that annoying, but this device is so awesome that I have high standards when it comes to its features. To put caps lock on or off, you have to hold down the search key (which is in the same place that a regular caps lock key is on a standard keyboard) and press alt. The keyboard it's self is really nice, click-y, and easy to type on overall, but as a touch typer who has never used this kind of keyboard before, it takes some getting used to. If you press just the search key alone by accident, it brings up this annoying pop up from the bottom of the screen that you can search google directly from, which I find pointless, because you can get the same feature from just touching/ clicking on the circle in the lower left hand corner of your screen. Also there is always an annoying little notification that comes up when I put the caps lock on that just needs to go away. \\r\\n\\r\\nAny way, I digress. This is a great computer for light, everyday use and I think it was well worth its price. Hope this review was helpful!\", 'My needs are few and simple, and this basic Chromebook suits the bill nicely.

But being able to take my work elsewhere, pay bills electronically while on vacation (which my iPad handles VERY differently via the mobile site and isn't nearly as user-friendly for that purpose), and carry this Chromebook around the house when I want to discuss an email or something with our kids has been priceless! I didn't realize how often I would find myself carrying it up to our bedroom and finishing up projects before falling asleep, so I do wish it had backlit keys but I'll keep that in mind for future purposes...it's definitely not a feature that warrants taking away any stars from my rating as this wasn't advertised as one of the features. I just didn't know how much I would have used it. The battery on this thing is unbelievable! For as often as I use it, it holds a charge for a very long time and I love the touchscreen option. I've mostly gotten used to the touchpad as well (versus having a mouse) and must admit it's very simple to use and has just the right sensitivity.

My only complaints are I wish the screen resolution was a little better, and I did have 2 instances when zoom froze for about 15 seconds, but I'm not sure if that was an issue with the chromebook or the internet/wifi.

My dad went out and bought me the Microsoft Works 2016. Since this is a chromebook I could not install it on my computer. Thankfully, since I had not scratched to reveal the code, they allowed him to return it. I have to use the Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc apps. My first semester in school I thought they were just fine. I just completed my second semester and took a basic computer class. I was not able to do my homework or any other assignments on my own computer because I needed the Microsoft Works Suite 2016 and I only had the apps. It was very difficult for me to find another computer to use to do my work for that class. Not only that, but I realized what a HUGE downgrade the apps are compared to the actual program you can purchase for windows. When I bought this Chromebook I had $3,000 from a student refund check, so money was NOT the issue. I genuinely thought this computer would be excellent for what I needed it for, because the guy who sold it to me told me it would be. Now, over the summer and before classes start again, I\\'m going to have to buy a whole other different computer because my degree program is for Business Management and this laptop does not meet my needs to succeed in my classes. I\\'m a straight A student, but I got a B in my computer class because it was so difficult to keep up with all the work not being able to do it at home on my own computer. The real Microsoft program and the free apps are SOOOOOOO much different. I\\'m also a single mom of a 14 year old girl who will start high school in the fall, and we just recently moved into our own place. The last thing I have room in my budget for right now is a new laptop for myself. Had I known that this Chromebook would be the way it is, I would have bought a different WINDOWS computer the first time, when I had the money. The thing is, the associate even told me that he had the Samsung Chromebook himself, so he definitely knew the difference. Why he would recommend this laptop, and tell me it would be great for college, is beyond me. I really thought the people that work at Best Buy knew what they are talking about, that\\'s why I went there. I tried to write this in an email to customer service but I\\'m not sure I even can email anybody to talk to about this. I used to think very highly of Best Buy, but this whole experience has really changed my opinion. I\\'m sure, since the chromebook was only $300 to begin with, it\\'s worth VERY little for trade in value. It would be nice if somebody from Best Buy would contact me to discuss this, but I won\\'t hold my breath.', 'Compact, easy to type, love the touch screen so good, for my corpal tunnel.', 'Android based system works great and simple to use with tablet capability', 'Not a lot of features but gets the job done.

   "reviews": "[\"The device is okay. The Home key sticks. I have to send it back to the manufacturer just to have them to look at it. Even though I purchased it from Best Buy. Seems like such a hassle to have to send it back to the manufacturer just to get the key fixed. I would not purchase another one that's for sure.\", 'This is my first time purchasing a laptop and I made the right choice! I love my new Lenovo.', 'Im very happy with this lab top its very convenient and it works great ..I highly recommend it because how nice it works and the battery so far is excellent tony from ny', 'This laptop is great for working at home or on the go. Great mouse pad.', 'Touch screen laptop that is light and fast, can even play light games. No lag on browsing smooth. Display is not bright and battery life is decent', 'This laptop is very fast. Very fast for an i3 specs. I ran  mulitple programs mainly office ones, it’s so fast. I don’t play games so I can’t tell. The abyss blue looks clean too. The design really rocks, although it says aluminum case but it feels plasticky, but the color and curves are very sleek, it shadows the plasticky feel. To be honest if I see this laptop on a table it looks like an expensive laptop. And for a 15.6 inch size, it looks and feels smaller if you are into that. It’s definitely not 17 inch, I have a 17 inch laptop and it’s monstrous. The screen brightness is not the best but I am not planning to use it under the sun, I’m more on the dimmer-side-user actually so it’s not an issue for me. \\nThe touch screen is a plus. One of the reasons I bought this is bec of that. I sign documents after I type them and sign it directly thru the screen. Definitely recommending this one.', 'It is a good computer.  Easy to use fast.\\n And with a good processor.', 'I love this laptop.  The color.  The quality and the style.', \"It's not a bad computer but it's not the best. The keyboard doesn't light up and compared to my more expensive one the screen quality lacks. I purchased it to trade so it is fine fir that purpose.\", 'Really like it. I haven’t used windows in a long time, I usually do Apple at work and I have an iPhone. But I love the touchscreen, it’s easy to use, it’s very light. It was very affordable. I would totally buy it again.  \\nI’m happy with my purchase. And I use it for college', 'So far so good. I bought this laptop because I had spilled a drink on my old one, and it could not be fixed. I was excited about this laptop, I was trying to buy it over Black Friday when it was on sale but they constantly sold out.\\nThe screen is lightweight, and the laptop is all around lighter than my older HP. The key setup feels comfortable and the mouse pad isnt too touchy. The speakers are loud and clear. The set up was easy and fast. Highly recommend for school.', 'When I first got it it worked perfectly fine than after a couple of minutes later it would restart and say boot error failed than I restarted it and it went back on again than soon enough it restarted randomly again with the no boot device fail error and just kept happening over and over again like a cycle', 'This is a great product! The screen is very dim and impossible to see in daylight EVEN WITH BRIGHTNESS ALL THE WAY UP. This is kinda expected because this is a budget laptop, but the overall performance is very good. It handles schoolwork excellently, there seems to be no problems whatsoever with handling schoolwork and light video editing. To my surprise, it handles Minecraft very well with up to 235 fps on low settings and 60 fps on high settings! I would totally recommend this laptop if the screen is not an issue to you :)', 'My Lenova Ideapad is a wonderful product. Just what I needed and just what I expected. It has all the features I like including the numerical keypad. This makes paying my bills online so much easier. I would definitely recommend it to my family and friends as well as anyone needing solid and dependable construction.', 'It’s a good laptop fast and the keyboard is nice and the screen is a good size', \"I was looking for a laptop that I could use primaly for music production. So far everything has been great and this product exceeded my expectations. \\n\\nSetup was simple. The touch screen option is great, I used it more than I thought I would.\\n\\nAnother cool option that I didn't realize until after I received it, was the camera cover. This little plastic strip that you slide over when you want to cover the camera lense. I probably wouldn't use this laptop for photos, videos, or Skype, but the option to block the camera was a cool touch.\\n\\nThe keyboard and mouse will take time to get used to, but that's something unrelated to the actual product.\\n\\nThe screen is a great size and makes seeing my DAW and plugins easier. Lots of cool options to synch phone and email to the laptop, which is cool for people who want that.\\n\\nRuns fast, good build. Really nothing negative to say.\", 'Build : So far, I really love the build of this laptop. Solid feeling keys, cool aluminum blue finish, light but feels sturdy. Touchpad hasn\\'t glitched out on me like previous Lenovo laptops which is a huge plus.\\n\\nDisplay : For a budget 720p display, it\\'s decent. Viewing angles are pretty good, there is a bit of backlight bleed around the edges but nothing too noticeable. Colors are pretty washed out but this is in comparison to my home monitor, perfectly acceptable for a $400 laptop IMO. \\n\\nCamera : Has awful scan lines that constantly go down the screen when viewing the camera. I\\'m not sure if I just got a defective camera but it\\'s pretty distracting. Other than that, the quality is decent for a 720p webcam.\\n\\nPerformance : Haven\\'t stress tested it too much but seems pretty snappy on the internet!\\n\\nSoftware : Woooo boy, this is where things get bad. Microsoft thought it would be a good idea to rope people into creating or linking a Microsoft account to use the laptop which is completely anti-consumer. If you buy a piece of hardware, you should expect to use it out of the box without having to give your personal data away. Microsoft doesn\\'t have the best track record when it comes to securing their users data either.\\n\\nIn all my previous Windows 10 computers, there is an option on the welcome splash screen to create a offline account, something that is completely missing from this laptop (I think they stripped the option from recent Home versions of Windows 10. Gotta collect that data I guess!) After linking the laptop to my wifi, I found that I was stuck on the \"Link your Microsoft Account\" screen with no way to go back or make an offline account.\\n\\nHowever I found a few workarounds. The easiest way is to skip connecting to wifi on the Windows 10 welcome screen. That will actually unlock the option to create an offline account (the fact that Microsoft disables it when you connect is absolutely wild). If you had already linked the wifi in the welcome screen, you can click create an account, add in a made up email address, and continue to your desktop.\\n\\nOnce you are finally on the desktop, you are greeted with a ton of Lenovo bloatware and terrible games. A great way to get a clean install without all the bloatware is to redownload Windows 10 (you can do this with the free \"Windows Media Creation Tool\"), and selecting the option to delete all files and settings with the redownload. This will give you a clean harddrive, faster performance, and no bloatware!\\n\\nNow the next step is disabling the crippling S mode so you can really unlock your Windows PC. Lo and behold, Microsoft makes you link your Microsoft account to the Microsoft app store in order to disable S Mode (They reaaaally want your data huh?) However I found another workaround. \\n\\n1) Search for Updates in your start bar and click on \"Check For Updates\"\\n\\n2) In the sidebar, click on \"Recovery\"\\n\\n3) Click on \"Restart Now\" under \"Advanced Startup\"\\n\\n4) From the maintenance screen, click on \"Troubleshoot\" and then \"Advanced Options,\" and then on \"UEFI Firmware Settings\" and then \"Restart\"\\n\\n5) From the BIOS settings screen, use your left and right keys to scroll to security and disable \"Secure Boot\"\\n\\n6) Go to the Exit tab and click \"Exit Saving Changes\"\\n\\n7) Once you log back in, you can search for \"About this PC\" and if everything worked, you should see that the Windows 10 Home version is no longer in S mode! All without giving away your data, Hooray!\\n\\n8) You can now go back to the BIOS and reenable secure boot\\n\\nNow you have a great budget laptop without bloatware and without giving away your data! Hope this is helpful! This laptop would be a 4-5 star if Microsoft and Lenovo didn\\'t make you jump through hoops to use the device you paid for.', 'This laptop was on sale for a great price of $379 for an entry to mid level touchscreen laptop.  Especially during this time of microprocessor shortages.\\n\\n 15.6\" LCD touchscreen with 720p HD display resolution 1366 x 768.  10th generation, i3-10110U processor for dual core processing.  8gb system memory for advanced multitasking.  Very capable for web browsing, and basic office tasks such as typing letters and email.  256gb solid state harddrive for fast startup at the beginning of your work day.  Saves and opens files swiftly.  Intel UHD graphics, basic on processor graphics for everyday internet and basic photo and video editing.  At this price point you wouldn\\'t expect this machine to have a high end, gaming capable experience.  Weighs only 4 lbs and thin design.  I do like that it was a modern, sleek aluminum design not typical of this price point.  You will usually have inferior, plastic build designs.  Not a big deal today due to most programs being in the cloud or downloadable.  They omitted the DVD/CD drive to make it lighter and thinner.  Only has Wi-Fi 5, but nominal sacrifice if you\\'re not gaming again considering the price.  Built in HD webcam and dual array microphone for Zoom and Skype.  Nothing super impressive, 720p but its clear and reliable and built in to the screen.  Preloaded with Windows 10 home in S mode.  This is for better performance and security.  However its very simple to search and leave S mode.  This will allow you to install third party programs.  Includes one HDMI output, one 2.0 usb port, and two 3.0 usb ports.  The keyboard is basic, kinda cheap feel, but includes a ten key keyboard which is useful for accounting and data entry.   Between 6 and 7 hour battery life which is adequate for home, school and small business use.', \"I bought this laptop for my daughter and she really likes it. So far she has been able to use it for school and to play games. My only concern is that the charging cord only worked for one month. I went in to Best Buy and instead of them replacing it, an employee pointed out where the charging cords were located within the store. Then I was told they were sold out of this particular cord and they are difficult to find. Due to this I probably won't purchase this brand again and will make technology purchases elsewhere.\", \"This is a really nice laptop for the price.  It is still the best spec'd laptop at its price even when not on sale.  The Intel Core i3 is more than enough to handle web browsing and conference calling.  I don't know if it can handle gaming or high def video, but it is more than enough for what we need.  The large SSD is also a plus as it is much fater than a traditional hard disc.  I would recommend this to anyone who just wants to surf the web, do some light office work, or video chat with their family.\", \"Needed to replace my 9 year old laptop and wanted something reasonably priced but with a good set of specs and features. This seemed to fit the bill in the store. But now it's a couple of months later and I'm still pretty happy with it. \\n\\nFirst thing I had to do was get the system out of S-Mode. The vast majority of things I do my machines is not going to be on the Windows Store. I'm thinking this is probably true for just about anyone. Unless it is a work machine you want to lockdown you may want to do this too.\\n\\nOnce I had Windows set up dual boot with Linux Mint. After configuring the GRUB loader got both OS configured and working. So,  yes, you can dual boot with this machine. \\n\\nThis laptop is a good, solid machine that should easily handle most average uses and applications. But it is not a very good option if you're wanting a gaming machine or video editing machine. So choose wisely. But for a daily driver this is a good choice.\", \"Got this yesterday for Granddaughter, the initial setup was a breeze. Yes, this has Windows 10s but it was easy to change to 10 home, search the web, and set up MS family so i can view what she is doing.  She loved it and she is so use to a touch screen.   it is a big screen but fairly light weight, keys were easy touch.  Charged fairly quickly to 100%, will see what happens when she comes home from school if it has held it's charge.  Much better than a chrome book you can do more.  This little laptop is great for someone that is a basic user, or for a younger child, on sale the price and stats could not be beat, thx LENOVO and best buy for offering a great alternative to a chrome book at such a reasonable price.\", 'This laptop is over all pretty good for a budget laptop, and the battery life and processing speed are better than expected. The only downside is the screen which reminds me of my dad’s old Dell monitors and feels like plastic. If your on a budget and don’t watch a lot of YouTube and movies than this should work great for you! But if screen resolution and quality is a priority, than I would go with something else. If you’re budget is a little bigger, than I’d recommend one of the Lenovo yoga models. In the end it’s up to what you can afford, and what your priorities are.', 'I purchased this for mywife and thus far, this laptop performs admirably.  The sound is a lot better than her previous laptop.  This was a key point in my choosing this brand and model.\\n\\nThe only thing I found a bit annoying is the touch screen.  Not that there is anything wrong,  it\\'s just that I forget it is a \"touch\" screen and I sometimes touch it and get unexpected results. Certainlt NOT a dealbreaker. It is vey clear for most video playback.\\n\\nAlso it\\'a very lightweight. This is a plus as my wife has arthritis and moving her older, heavier laptop could be painful.  \\n\\nAll on all, I wouldrecommend thisfor the average user, like my wife ( e-mail, shopping, general internet browzing,etc.).', 'after much resistance, hemming and hawing and feeling like one of the last century hold outs... Having heard of the Geek Squad I took a deep breath and walked into Best Buy. I was well taken care of by the knowledgeable young man who waited on me. There was no question too elementary and answers were easy to understand. I fell in love with my Lenovo laptop. I am finishing a manuscript. The computer is comfortable. I purchased a wireless keyboard so writing is a breeze. The outside teal color is fabulous. My desktop is going to have to adjust :-) to a poly-computer relationship.', \"I got this as a 3rd laptop mainly to watch nest cams, and it's so light and easy to work with (compared to my 2 Dell workhorse laptops) that I often use it as my main laptop.  I'm familiar with Lenovo because I worked for IBM for a decade.  These are quality laptops for the money!  Excellent speed, colors, responsiveness.  I augment the storage with a 400gb sd card but the 256gb SSD is quite enough for my purposes for this laptop.  Excellent value for the money!\", \"I purchased the Lenovo Laptop, and had all my data transferred by the Geek Squad in Noblesville. We encountered an enormous amount of difficult as a result of Microsoft and Yahoo roadblocks and barriers. But thanks to the perseverance of Geek Squad's Noah, Mathew, Dakota and Patrick everything is perfect. And when I say perseverance, I mean PERSEVERANCE! They would not quit until everything was functioning to my satisfaction. I've lost some respect for Microsoft, AT&T, and Yahoo as a result of their contributions to my data transfer issues. But pleased I am a total tech support subscriber to Geek Squad, Bottom line, I am very pleased with my purchase.\", \"Bought it for work and it's perfect. I've got it hooked up to a second monitor, wireless keyboard, wireless trackball, and a wireless headset. I work with multiple programs through a remote server daily and it never slows down. \\n\\nThe one complaint is there's no ethernet port and only 3 usb ports. I usb hub solved the port problem and I bought a usb to ethernet. Still, why no ethernet port?\", 'I like my new Lenovo.  The screen is very clear and sharp. I like the fact that I can change the color and size of my pointer.  I kept loss my pointer until I found I could change it.  I have used a mouse since they made computers for the home.  I am working on using the little pad to move my curser.  I hope to figure out how to move the page up since I no longer have a mouse to work with.  Over all this is a good computer.  I would buy it again.  I like looking and finding how to work things on it instead of ready the instructions.  I just found the button to close my camera.  I like the speed which is much faster than my old computer.', 'I love how this laptop has a project feature. I can do watch all my movies from my laptop to my television. I just wish the keyboard lit up. Also when I shut down my laptop the battery still goes down. It’s like my laptop is in sleep mode… I’ll shut down the laptop and as soon as I open it the laptop automatically turns on. When I left home (8) hours my laptop was on 62 in the shut down mode but when I came back it was on 60. I’m not sure if something is wrong but I don’t like that feature this laptop provides. I want my laptop to stay shut down and not be secretly active in the background.', 'Overall a really nice laptop for the budget. This performs pretty well running office apps and the touchscreen is nice and makes up for the average trackpad. The casing is probably the weakest part of the laptop as the corners are a little \"sharp\" feeling. I\\'m not sure of the durability over the long haul but all-in-all it\\'s a great machine for the budget.', 'Love this laptop my son likes it a lot great for home schooling and do homework and navigate online super fast and productive i will buy again also the price you can be that price was really good as well touchscreen is a plus my son love this one i think he will enjoy for a good time onto the next one we will buy this brand again worth the money thanks', \"I bought this laptop over 2 months ago for my college classes. It works great! I saw some reviews that complained about the screen brightness being too dim, but I have had no issues with that. You have to disable something in order to have other apps that aren't from Microsoft. It works well for all my classes. The camera quality is okay, but that was expected with the price I paid. Overall been a great buy for me!\", 'Its a good product and Nate and Drew are amazing however Danny pressured me so much in store I actually started to cry and had to request someone else to check me out. It was clear he got paid by commission or had some type of number to reach because he made me feel horrible for not buying the two extra protection plans that are offered.', 'Best Buy makes life so easy for us busy people. I took my old lap top in to be fixed but it was beyond help. As I said it was old.\\nSo I went over to the salesperson and he found exactly what I needed. So he took it over to the Geek  Squad, they already knew what I wanted.  So they wrote the order and I had my laptop ready to go in a few days. \\nIt was a win win for me... and a win win for them.', \"Bought this on an excellent sale (back to school) for my wife after her old laptop from 10 years ago died, it actually died a while ago and she has been wanting a new one ever since. I compared a bunch of laptops for a while, then the sale hit. The price was insane so I finally got this one for her birthday thinking she would not use it that much. She is on it all the time which is money well spent. She is a internet surfing, video watching (youtube, netflix, hulu), game playing (card games, touch screen swipe and slide games, phone style games), online shopping kind of woman so this fits her perfectly. It connected to the WIFI here on the network no problem. It seems really fast to boot blowing my 5 year old desktop out of the water, her SSD vs my SATA is the key. She loves the color (dark blue). I bought her a 2TB thumb drive for storage back up but she has not even opened it yet. The smaller resolution (720) is not bad but is noticeable compared to my bigger monitors (1080p) but she has no problem with it nor do I, especially after you tweak it with smallest icons and dark theme, makes a big difference in the way it looks. Has touchscreen which my wife said she did not like...at first, now she loves it and the keyboard is not lit but it is huge, like full size and she has mentioned how much she loves that multiple times, even others have mentioned how big the keyboard is and I have not used it much but it feels nice and is soft to the touch but still firm enough to not feel cheap. This is by no means a power house laptop but it is good for possibly a student or someone not needing a high end super gaming rig laptop, or maybe even someone on a budget not wanting to spend $1K or more for higher end brands with more bells and whistles. Keep in mind, storage is small with only 256GB SSD. Also, comes with a locked (secure) version of Windows10 but it can be easily unlocked, look on youtube for info. Have not really tested the battery life but it was being used for at least 6 hours without being plugged in on the second day of use, it's usually plugged in so far. I am very happy with this purchase (so is my wife) and I am also thinking about getting one for myself to have for tuning quadcopters in the field, this would fit the bill perfectly. Fits in my backpack with all my gear.\", \"I needed a small laptop for small task's. This one fit the bill! \\nI did not  however pay attention to the windows 10s. Installed on laptop, when I purchased it. First thing I did was get key to convert to windows 10. After doing so I installed Brave internet browser. Deleted the windows edge browser, along with office and any other bloat wear that windows installs! As far as I can see this thing is still snappy and doing everything I need it to do. Also I installed libre office, and I use Malwarebytes for anti virus.\", \"For the price, excellent. My aunt needed a replacement laptop after her HP died. This does NOT have a full HD (1080p) screen, but it is matte and touchscreen. My older relatives don't like tiny fonts anyway and can't tell a difference, so paying extra for an FHD screen doesn't make sense. The screen is good quality.\\n\\nOther than the screen, it's quick and build quality is decent. The touch screen works well, and 8GB RAM + 256GB SSD is the perfect entry level combination. It boots up in a matter of seconds and the keyboard and touchpad have a good feel. My aunt is very happy. I typically use a new MacBook Air or a high spec'd ThinkPad for myself, but this Lenovo is the perfect home/school/office use computer if you mostly do email, office work, videos, that sort of thing. It's plenty fast to keep up.\\n\\nNote: it comes out of the box with Windows in S mode, where you can only install programs from the app store. It's free to switch it out of S mode into regular Windows 10 Home, which I did - not a problem at all.\", \"Bought this as a laptop for travel.  It's not as light as smaller tablets, but has more functionality.  Very well priced for a touchscreen, which just adds to the ease of use.  Don't have as much experience with Lenovo, but initially, I'm very pleased.  No backlit keyboard, in case that is important to anyone.  It was not a deal breaker for me.\", 'Good price for a laptop. It’s light,  easy to use and activate. I only use it for writing. The storage is not a lot but you can connect an external drive. If you want to carry a laptop and not be worried about being stolen like a Mac Pro, buy it. Also I have an old Hp keyboard and tried to see if it works in Lenovo, it works,  also charges easily, and you can use it for 3 to 4 hours', \"It's a good computer. As a Mac user my input probably doesn't hold much value.... However, I will say it's good for its intended purpose. If you want good screen quality, good camera quality or an extremely fast computer look elsewhere. All in all its a good bang for your buck if you're using it for an additional device (or in my case for a new staff member) this is a good choice.\", 'I enjoy the Lenovo Ideapad. It has everything I want and need.\\nI like having the numbers pad on the right-hand side of the keyboard\\n\\nI need to pay attention when I start typing. \\nOverall it was of great value and an excellent laptop.', 'The Lenovo - Ideapad 3 15 15.6\" Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i3 - 8GB Memory - 256GB SSD - Abyss Blue is a very good laptop with great expandability.

The young man who waited on me talked me out of one he said I would not like, and that I would return to get a better one in a year's time.  I left the store without making a purchase so that I could think about his advice.\\nAbout a week later I returned and purchased the Lenovo Ideapad.

Not everyone needs the greatest and latest chips to meet everyday computing needs!', 'I was so hesitant as reviews said the screen brightness was very dim. It is dim but it’s actually nice.

The fact that it is also touch screen is a bonus.', 'Perfect machine for a light user.  I surf the web and play a few games.

It has 3 PS2 ports, an HDMI port, a chip reader, and an earphone jack. That's sufficient for my use.\\n\\nThe only downside is the color. Initially, out-of-the box the colors were faded and the pictures on Zoom were horrible. I found a utility in the settings that allowed me to re-calibrate the color spectrum.

Very disappointed', \"Great performing laptop for the price, but as others have stated, the display leaves a lot to be desired. Also, the bottom corners of the laptop are very sharp and make it uncomfortable to use the laptop on your lap or while lying in bed. This is a laptop that's best used hooked up to an external display with a wireless keyboard & mouse, in my opinion, to get around the poor display and the slightly uncomfortable form factor. The keyboard of this laptop is average, and the inclusion of the 10-key is nice, but the keys still feel a bit mushy and don't offer much feedback or travel.\", 'A fine performance touch-screen Lenovo for daily uses. An i3 core processor and 8GB memory is not quite an impressive combination but you will not be dispointed as long as you do not operate large memory-consuming software. The color design is quite good, deep sea blue looks really fascinating and the touch is pretty solid, a mosaic polish. It boots up really fast for now, I think it is because it is a new PC. I used to have X1 and Y70, both slowed down after one or two years. But for a PC like this, it is supposed to be replaced every few years.', 'This is my 2nd Lenovo Ideapad.  So speedy to boot up and run basic programs.  Best computer on the market for the money.  I would never buy a computer with a SSD drive.  Also Light weight to travel with.

The CPU and RAM are sufficient for what I need - I’m actually pretty impressed with the speed - it’s better than I expected at this price point.  The build quality is decent enough - there is flex in the palm wrest but it isn’t as bad as I was expecting.  The image quality is atrocious, with poor viewing angles, abysmal contrast and terrible color quality.  I would prefer a better panel with higher resolution over having a touch panel.  I plan to RDP to the machine from an iPad in the field (required an upgrade to Win 10 Pro) after connecting to my Phone hotspot, so I will be primarily using the iPad’s display, which will be much better.  If you’re a regular PC user looking for something to use every day I would strongly suggest looking at something with a better screen, but if you are a niche user like me who just needs a machine and don’t plan on spending a lot of time using its screen directly, this could work for you.\\n\\nFew other thoughts: this machine has Windows 10 S Mode, so you will need to take it out of S mode to install non Microsoft App Store approved programs.  This machine ships with a fair amount of bloat ware but nothing too troublesome to remove.', 'Nice laptop. Fast, light weight. \\n Good quality for the price', 'bought a new laptop.
